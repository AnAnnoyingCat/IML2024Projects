(Gasp)Thats bad!,"I absolutely despised the voiceovers, I thought someone has secretly replaced Sara with C-Ko Kotobuki before the movie, and the lines were awful ( (Fakey gasp)THATS BAD!). ADV also screwed the character's personalities from ANY Sonic video game, comic, or TV show. KNUCKLES IS NOT SONIC'S BEST FRIEND! FOR MOST OF THE SERIES THEY HATED EACH OTHER'S GUTS! But even so, it was still fun to watch and lots of fun to riff."
One of God's Little Angel,"Mattie, I can see what a kind, caring, spirit, you have when I saw you on TV. Reading about and looking at you on TV let me see his inner spirit. God has a job for him to do to show us that we can go on with our lives. He is special I know to his mother. I have listen to him on the TV and he is telling us a lot if we/you listen to what he is telling us. Mattie, I am also disable, but I refuse to let anything stop me from writing. I hope you will be happy and you can make others happy through your writing. Keep up the good work. God bless you and your family Mattie."
Would Hate To Hear The Worst,"Chet Baker certainly does have his apologists. Phrases such as, ""He can't sing, but ..."" are repeated like mantras. Fact is, he just plain can't sing. He has a sort of hipper-than-thou whisper that broadcasts, ""I'm such a sensitive artiste."" For some reason, people bought it. Blame it on the good looks, the smack habit, the James Dean act, and the times, which glorified everything unstudied and done badly - (read Kerouac). He was a nice, if unremarkable, horn man. But that singing, wow. You'll get more passion from your dishwasher, and more technique too. Baker's real brilliance was in passing off attitude for art, something that survives to this day. He was at the avante garde of being a poseur."
"Buy his other CDs, not this one!","Richard Cheese does *NOT* own the rights or royalties to this album. The record company that produced it (Oglio Records) ripped him off. This CD IS great... but if you believe in supporting artists buy his other albums instead, since if you buy this he won't see a dime. His 'best of' album, Sunny Side of the Moon, has several songs from this album. I highly recommend it."
4 in 1,"This game is okay, but I lose interest very easy. If you like board games, then you'll probably like this. I can only play checkers, so that's why I'm not to thrilled with it."
Bimbo Jones Remix,"This is worth it for the full lentgh Bimbo Jones remix of the song and you get the video too! The Beat Cult remix is okay, but mediocre at best."
MONO not STEREO,"The biggest revelation about this Japanese reissue for the first time on CD complete is that those responsible for issuing this session released it in it's MONO form, not STEREO. When originally released in 1959 in LP form, STEREO was available; I know I own the record in its STEREO configuration and the sound quality is exceptional for an LP from this period. Therefore, it is curious why the MONO version was chosen, and not the STEREO version, for release on CD at this time.With this said, the CD sound quality is enjoyable enough."
"Good for the price, but flash recycling time is long","Well it cost about $8 and it has about the same level of charge that the original battery but the flash recycling time with this battery is about twice the time as with the canon original, if you don't have to use flash in every photo is totally recommendable, but if you need flash think twice because you are gonna need to be asking people to wait, but well it happens too with the original battery the difference is that with this happens from start and not when the battery is half charged"
Do not fall for this,If you think you are getting insight on ingredients or recep's you will be disappointed. It just gives a short story about the BBQ joint and the sauces served. 2 stars are being generous.
punk-emo-screamo-post hardcore,"this is a good cd if you like hawthorne heights or silversteinin fate's hands is one of the best songs on the cdoverall, its a good cd some songs sound more poppy and some are emoits a good cd2 thumbs up"
Absolutely fantastic!,"Our boat cover is three years old and had developed a couple of soft spots where water would seep through when it rained. We put the Starbrite solution into a regular hand spray bottle and with the cover on the boat, we sprayed a layer over the whole thing. That was on Sunday afternoon and of course, on Wednesday and Thursday we had torrential rains, so when we went to the boat Friday evening, we expected to see some of the usual water inside. THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NONE!!! The cover is now completely waterproof again and even more surprising, it's as soft as the day we bought it!This is a truly fantastic product and we'll be using it to treat our cover every year from now on!"
"Good author, not some of his best work","I don't know, I thought this seemed like a great idea. And maybe in some markets it is. In Philadelphia, it's different from the authors home of Florida and I just didn't get anything out of reading this book. When he says options are a little known used RE tool, he ain't lying! After reading Mr. Lucier's book I realized that this was a concept that was completely impractical for me. Some of his stories about finding warehouses that sat vacant for years, cleaning the floor and a coat of pain and voila! $25000 profit, well, they just seem totally out there to me. If you think you can make a go of it, yes, it takes little money but this concept is seldom used and not going to work in many places."
hp ac adapter,product arrived quickly and was exactly wht i needed. also very low price which makes it even better!
STUPID: Owner may not replace battery!,"Well, this is the most idiotic thing. When the battery dies - and the battery *will* eventually die, you have to ship it to a repair center for replacement! I live in NYC, so I have to pack it up and send it to California - the only center in the USA that Sanyo refers to handle the unit?I spoke to the repair center and the cost would be $25 for a diagnosis, plus $40 for labor, plus shipping costs: $65+ to replace a tiny battery! Even the person I spoke to at the repair center thought it was economically ridiculous to send the unit to them just to replace the battery, and she tried to dissuade me from doing it.Seriously, you have to disassemble the unit in order to get to the front panel, then disassemble the electronic front panel to get to the battery. I kid you not. Trust me, it ain't easy - and you risk breaking something in the process. Unless you feel comfortable performing brain surgery, stay away from this unit!Sanyo - very, very, stupid."
this game SUCKS BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i used to play the free trials but after your third trial they dont let you have another one but they leave fetures out on the free trial so i bought this and i said ONLY 2 MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! what the this game sucks (unless your rich)
Still waiting for the One,"Four stars for the music, which holds up very well indeed, in addition to bringing back many fond memories from my youth.Two stars for the mediocre remastering, which sounds oh so very, very ""digital"", i.e., thin, harsh and tinny, though louder than the initial CD release. Wish they'd done this one in HDCD instead, like the King Crimson and Roxy Music remasters. Perhaps the SACD version offers a broader soundstage and more midrange and bass?One star for the lousy packaging, which picks up scuffs and fingerprints easily and grabs too tight a hold of the CD. (For an example of how to do digipak right, see King Crimson's digipack-ed release of ""Thrack Attack"".) I'd suggest waiting for the jewel case release of this one before purchasing.So, two stars overall. Maybe they'll get it right with the next remastering...."
Only for the terribly twisted - which I proudly am!,"This movie plays off of probably one of the sickest, most demeaning of acts. It makes most people cringe. But then, in the end, looks at it for what it is and realizes that it's not the most possibly demeaning thing possible...Most people do way worse, more disgusting acts for pleasure.If you're buying this movie for an intense crime drama where the wrong guy is accused, then for the most part you're wrong. That's not the primary meaning of the word ""fingered"" here. If that freaks you out, you should move on. But if you enjoy more risque humor once in awhile, and can laugh at an unfortunate series of events leading up to that point (told as a hazy backstory that gets clearer and clearer), then this movie is HILARIOUS!I'm just hoping that the NC-17 blu-ray version that Tom Green promised comes out, so I can update my copy."
Excelent Reference and Teaching Tool,"Succeeds where Brian Kernighan's ""The C Programming Langauge"" fails. Concise enough to use as a handy reference for the veteran C programmer, yet robust enough to include examples for most programming constructs. Highest reccomendation."
worth the expense!,"Energize yourself... Iron, B vits, herbs. Gentle on your stomach, taste is fair, works fast improving iron levels and overall feeling of wellbeing and energy. Competitive pricing on Amazon."
Missing the point,"Once you start telling people how to live, the whole idea of Tao is gone. The whole point of Tao is to live, in the constant stream of life, in the way that lets you blend with the environment. You can't tell someone how to do that. There is no guide to how each person should live their life. Tao is finding the way that works for you, and the rest of the world, in harmony on your own path, no guides."
U ALREADY KNOW they were hot,"When i first heard that 112 left bad boy i though this album was going to suck, but i was wrong i went out and bought it like every true 112 fan and i wasn't disapointed.My favorite songs:3. What if (slim let his good vocals show on this one)4. U already know (The hot single)6. Nowhere (second favorite song7. Last to know9.My mistakes (Nice ballad to ride 2)10. If i hit (a club banger)13. Why can' we get along15. Closing the club (Even mike rapped on this hot matha)17. Only god knows (My favorite song on the albumThe songs i though was pain5. Damn (cant even lisen to it11. The way (JD sucks big time)16. What the hell do you wantI liked the cd and you will too so get your ass up and go buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
VERY sorry!,"Before purchasing this Freshflow Fountain I 'watered' my dogs via a stainless-steel bowl in a raised feeeding-station. Having bought the LARGEST one which is quite expensive, I now truly wish I'd stayed with that arrangement. When I'm out of filters (bought three packages w/fountain) I shall go BACK to previous arrangement!This thing is AWFUL to clean; there are numerous crevices & corners that my long/narrow brush cannot reach & believe me, it needs cleaning at least twice weekly. I have two Yorkies & a Golden, so it gets well-used but even so, it's extremely labor-intensive. The fountain is just TOO much work to give them a clean, sanitary container from which to drink. It is is VERY heavy when the water-level is as it needs to be; lifting it to the sink is very hard on one's back, especially for those of us who are seniors, as am I.The ads for this are VERY misleading, 'easy to clean'? Not hardly, this thing is a nightmare!Sincerely, V. Le Gare"
"Wow, I must have missed something.","For the life of me I can't understand how so many people liked this book. Far from being ""on the edge of your seat"" come the end, I thought the ending was pretty much a ""who cares"" as it involves characters that had little role throughout the previous 350 pages. Perhaps if you like lame mysteries, you'll like this too."
Not too shabby,I have begun my second semester of business major classes. This semester I am taking Management and I have the same teacher as I did for Marketing last semester. He has selected two basic vocabulary educational books. Fundamentals of Management has been a good book in explaining the vocabulary and the text book rules of management. The layout of the chapters is in a reasonable order to understand management. The charts are very useful and the outline at the beginning of each chapter and the sample questions at the end of each chapter help prepare for the test. I highly recommend this book if you want to teach the text book rules.
As good as I imagine they could be.,"Product is very good, and retailers description and shipping was excellent. While I still prefer wearing nothing, these are about the next best option for me!"
My first from this author but not my last,"Good, fast read, researched well enough so you got a good feel for everyone involved. Will be reading this author again"
He Sees You When Your Sleeping,"I think this is a great book for all types of people. Sterling, the main character , had unforgetable encouters and helped the lives of several people. This book made me think of how life would be like after death and how good you should be to others. This story took place near Christmas. I would recomend reading it towards the end of the year. I recommend this book to everyone."
Bad Services,"I was wondering, cause after 5 days they send to me a sorry message and my money back because they didn't have the book any more.What a good deal!"
Plastic Speaker yields Plastic Sound,"Everyone that raves about the sound of this unit must probably have a lower tolerance for average sound quality. Bose is the only company that I have experience with that can make a high quality sound come from a plastic housing.(I want to test out the Klipsch unit as I am very impressed with their other products.) It plays music if that is what you want, but don't believe that there is a huge range of accoustical reproduction and there is certainly no deep base or crisp highs.We have the unit in our nursery to play baby music, so it is acceptable for it's application. It's price is also pretty reasonable for its current use.However if I had to listen to this myself, I would either buy the Bose, Klipsch or connect this to my home stereo.Also, there is no adaptor for the Nano provided."
"For Breyer Classics Size Horses, Durability Issues","I purchased this barn for my animal-crazy young daughter. While the bright plastic roof seemed sturdy enough, I was disappointed to open the box and find out that the side walls are made of cardboard. The floor of the barn is also a cardboard piece. The upright posts are plastic, as are the back opening windows. The side windows do open and close, but they are cardboard.This barn is built for the Breyer Classics model horses. The Breyer Traditional models and Barbie horses are too large for the barn.Within the first 24 hours of owning the barn, I had to put it back together four times. The following day I used a tube of Super Glue to lock everything down so it would stop falling apart.While this barn looks attractive, it is not very durable. If your child is tough on their toys, this barn is not for you."
"good story, but too short","I think this is one of the weaker books that Jude Deveraux has written in recent years. The plot itself is interesting. What would you do if you were given a chance change your life after re-living 3 weeks of it? Would you choose the new life and forget the old one, choose it but remember the old life, or stay with your old life?Unfortunately, the book was too short and sometimes too melodramatic. I wished it were longer. It's simply too short to cover 3 women's life, spanding 19+ years. Other reviewers have said this. She spent 2/3 of the book recounting (very quickly) their present life. And the last 1/3 on how they choose to change their past. Some of their stories were just too tragic and you felt she was exaggerating in order to get the contrast of before and after across.In any case, still a good book since Deveraux always writes well. But definitely could have been better."
A Very Negative View of Anne Boleyn,"As a historian, I purchased this book for my daughter, hoping to present her with an account of a flawed woman who struggled to bring reformation to the church. Instead of a subjective interpretation by the author, Anne Boleyn was vilified. Those looking for a story about a young girl in the court of Henry VIII might enjoy it."
One of the year's best under radar cd's,"I kept hearing about this band all over the internet...finally decided to check it out. I was expecting an emo album, but to my surprise not much emo about it. This is experimental rock, all the songs from this album are a continuation of a sci-fi type story of Coheed and Cambria (the two main characters in this story). Because it is experimental and progressive most people will either hate it or love it. I happened to love it."
Good when your bored.,"If your looking for good action, cutting edge graphics, and or a surreal sound experience ... keep looking.But if your looking for an easy game to waste some time, and like the ""outdoors man"" spoof concept. Then the various ""Avenger"" games are a good place to start. Once figured out the K.I.S.S. style controls (keep it simple stupid) make for a rapid learning curve. I drop this one, or Deer 1 or 2, in when I'm bored and not in the mood to dig into a long play game.The one draw back to the ""Avenger"" games is the obvious, and generally simple patterns. Although ""Deer 2"" did a markedly better job of upping the difficulty.The only real challenge to this game is trying to beat your times and weights."
Making natural milk soap,The book explaned well how to make the soap but the ingredience were not easy to find. I guess I wanted a recipe that would be easier to use.
Sludge Hounds Knocking,"Biscuits & Slavery CD. Led heavy from this US band that rocks like a battleship in a thunderstorm. Some classic southern elements, with a stoner attitude and slide guitars all over the place. Rednecks ? Hell yeah ! ROSE TATTOO meets LYNYRD SKYNYRD meets BLACK SABBATH."
Land of the Loon is Best music and nature sounds CD ever,I have looked all over for the Perfect nature sounds and music CD and I believe I have found it! The nature souds are incredibly real (and non-looped) and the music is perfectly partnered. I love it!
horrible-waste of money,after only two weeks of use coating coming off! now after six weeks every pan in set has coating coming off! totally worthless! i thought cuisnart meant quality..totally a waste of money!
Great for the bath,"As other reviewers have mentioned these make excellent bath toys for kids into dolphins and whales. Bath toys with holes make no sense! These float and collect zero mold. That being said the quality isn't fantastic, if you're expecting Schleich you will be sorely disappointed. The heads are actually visibly attached to the body on a seam which is really distracting to me, although my daughter could care less. Overall, a good buy for the price."
Too brief to be of use for anyone serious on Bible study.,"This is an abridged version of the Expositor's Bible Commentary, which to start with is already too brief and too unsubstantiating in its comments on the Biblical texts. After abridgement, it is worse!"
Sublime,"This CD is sublime. It is simply beautiful. One of the best trance tracks I've heard. I bought it cos it had reincarnation and Did You Hear Me on it and I guessed if those tracks were on it, everything else would be good as well. I was right. Perfection."
Worth It!,"I had discovered the joys of using softcup last year and I really liked it, but I found myself still rinsing them out and reinserting them. After doing this for multiple periods I knew I was ready to try diva cup. I can say that I really enjoy it! I had a hard time initially getting it not to leak (because I was putting it in wrong), but after a day of practice things are great and I can totally tell when it is time to empty it. No complaints, especially from my wallet!"
"Don't waste time on this machine, even if it's free!","I just receieved this exact coffeemaker from Gevelia. First of all, the coffemaker is designed like a tripod, with the weight concentrated in the front. When you add the glass pot, it's a disaster waiting to happen. Secondly, after two uses, the water level indicator ball quit working. I would not purchase this coffeemaker again. I actually found this coffeemaker while looking for a replacement on Amazon. I'm giving the unit 2 stars because it brewed coffee. Not well, but it was coffee."
At least they're consistant....,"Ah Creed. To think that when I heard their first album I thought they had potential. They might have, but that all ended with Human Clay. I owned this cd for a little while, and I must admit, sometimes I really enjoyed listening to it. However, one thing stuck out to me like nothing else - all the songs are the EXACT same. They're the same tempo (I swear they used a metronome on the same tempo for the whole dang cd), the same structure, and the list goes on. It gets to the point where you might as well put one track from the album on repeat and you're not missing anything. Amazon chose an excellent word: redundant. Seriously, there are SO many other, better bands out there if people would just make the effort to find them. Unfortunately, that would require effort, and heaven forbid we do anything on our own. I'll get off my soapbox now, but hopefully this was helpful to anyone who was thinking of wasting away precious money on this."
Enjoyable!,"I brought this CD the day it was released. I think that the tracks by Before Dark,Jennifer Paige and Amber are great! I love this album and I'm not even a teenager anymore!"
great remixes!,"i just noticed that this single had no reviews, so if you're wondering whether or not to pick it up maybe i can be of service to you.The Blood Is Love (Contradicktator Mix) FLAT OUT GREAT. Starts of with eerie atmospheric piano and a lonely cold rendering of Josh Homme's voice. Then it explodes into a drum 'n bass MARCH! It's hard to describe, but it's really really fun to listen to. One of the coolest remixes i've heard in a long long time.Little Sister (Contradicktator Mix) Almost like a techno lounge version of the song. Not quite as stellar as the Blood Is Love remix, but also very very enjoyable.All in all, it's totally worth the money. The remixes sound really fresh, they're anything but cookie cutter techno stamped versions of the songs."
"Very sad, painful read","This is one of the saddest books I've ever read. I'm usually okay with sad, especially when there's a great lesson or a happy ending. I picked this book up because I thought I would get a better understanding of how very overweight people feel and how they live there lives day to day. I was way off on that - what I got was a terribly depressing detailed account of a horribly abusive and neglectful childhood. The only plus about this book is that it is a very quick read so you can get it over with quickly."
Rips like paper.,"In combination with a generous amount of duct tape, this product is very useful. In short, the thing rips easily. That being said, the product was invaluable. I had to move a mattress down a set of very dirty stares (4 flights), and the cover kept the mattress intact. So - good product, needs to improve on the material though."
Replacement Parts,"I purchased this grind and brew coffeemaker over a year ago, and have been fairly satisfied. Cleaning is complicated, and it is difficult keeping the water reservoir clean. However, the biggest problem is that there are NO REPLACEMENT parts available. I dropped the grinder/basket and the spring loaded mechanism broke. Cuisinart will not replace that part; therefore, I can't fix the coffee pot and I have lost my $$$ investment. What a shame. I'll not purchase Quisinart products in the future."
Fixed font,"This version uses a fixed font that causes inappropriate line breaks, making the book difficult to read on my Kindle. For example, some lines have only one word. I returned the book to Amazon for a refund."
Waterpick,I bought this waterpick for my daughter to use. It really helps get everything out of her orthodontic appliances. She doesn't like how strong the stream can be--even when we use the least heavy pick.
Powerfull,"David J. Lieberman has written one great book. After reading this book I look at the world entirely different. Almost every time I see a commercial I spot a technique used in this book. One of the things I like best about it is how it is set up. If you want to get someone to do something for you, you just flip to the appropriate chapter and you're set! In fact, I used one of the techniques on my mom to get her to buy me another one of his books!"
BEST FILM ON THE WORLD,SANDRA IS VERY NICE PEOPLE AND SHE IS BEATUFUL. SHE IS THE BEST MOVIE STAR NOW! I'M FROM FINLAND AND MY ONLY HOPE IS ATT I MEET SOMEDAY HER!
Expectations not met,"I expected more from this book. With all the accolades it received, I was expecting a great read, one that I couldn't put down. What I got was just an okay book. The book is overly wordy and too detailed. The detail definitely got tedious. The story was nothing great.I wouldn't recommend it."
Worthwhile for anyone who's ever been in huge debt!,"I could totally relate to Karyn's situation in her book, and it even inspired me to finally get my own credit card debt paid off. Though i didn't set up a website, at least it got me motivated to get to work! So far, i've gone from $5,000 to less than $1,800 in credit card debt. Not bad!Karyn writes very well and keeps things lighthearted. I felt like i was reading a book written by either myself or my own best friends. She realized the true ""pickle"" she had gotten herself into, and found an ingenious way to solve the problem. i couldn't agree more that most people were probably only offended by the site because they hadn't thought of it first!Worthwhile reading for anyone who's been in over their head, and definitely a must read for anyone who is in over their head right now!"
Awful,"This was tight in all the wrong spaces, not supportive at all. Waste of money, wish I had returned it"
Beautiful book,"Beautiful pictures, beautiful text. Cynthia Rylant is lyrical in describing nature's organisms. These animal stories emphasize the diversity of nature and some of the curiosities of animal behavior that can really grab the imagination and encourage further questioning.By the way, the two previous reviews are inaccurate. Rylant does mention monarchs in Mexico and her timetable for the migration doesn't conflict with the presence of monarchs in Iowa in Sept. or in Texas in Oct. The book is accurate on these points."
mostly advertisement,This tape was very basic. It seemed to promote her products more than anything else. The tips were for the biggener.Most of the tips you could get out of any fasion magizine. Laura has such talent I really expected more. I would get kevin Aucoins books. They offer lots of great tips. I just hope he comes out with a vidio!
Just OK,"I was very disappointed in this book. There are a lot better ones out there; Vanderpoel is excellent; I would say, don't waste your money on this one!"
Poor Bella,"As I watch what must be the WORST movie of the year I can't help but feel sorry for poor Bella.If her boyfriend isn't a boring vampire then her other boyfriend is a boring werewolf! Me thinks Bella should dump both of them, go back to Florida, live with her mother and find herself a nice Jewish boy.Is this is a new trend in he horror genre? To bore people to death?"
Disturbing...,"Another great story from the master...Jessie is a normal girl. She paints and has friends and loves to laugh. The problem is there is a fat man who lives in her apartment building. Like a troll, he lives under the stairs. He subsists only on coke-a-cola- and cheese doodles. His fingers are stained orange from the junk food. He is unattractive and he smells. Despite all this, Jessie finds herself obsessing over the man. He keeps telling her that he has nice things to show her in his apartment. When she does break down and enter his place, what he has to show her will keep you awake for a week and make you never enter a stranger's house again. It's that disturbing.Thank you Mr. Martin.Relic113"
intercooler,it didn't work for about a week and then it began to work. We'll seee how long it lasts...
total dribble as well as boring,"What is it with all these authors who are trying desperately to make money off an admittedly fictional book. Just because they didn't think of it first, doesn't give them the right to critize someone else's work of fiction. Does a piece of fiction have to have ALL their facts correct with no tolerance for creativity and literary license? According to Amy Welborn, the answer is no as she tags her name to the best selling book ""The Da Vinci Code"" by Brown in an effort to make some money off the fame of the book herself. She needs to grow up and write her own book that she creates from her own mind rather than stealing from other peoples works to make her own living."
Entertaining,"Despite the weak storyline and predictable dialogue, it is the constantly curious plot and amazing cast performance (in spite of their obstacles) that keeps you mildly amused. While not as inspirational as Roger Ebert would have you believe, it is still a curiously entertaining feel-good film that should leave you smiling. The audio commentary by Director Mark Pellington reveals just how large a film can seem on such a small location and budget."
A new approach to Horror,"The opening scene alone is proberly more frightening than most horror movies are throughout . it features two kids driving back from college to spend there summer break with family but unfortunately they get a few suprises on the way when a mystery black truck appears and makes there journey a lot more than they bargained for .......this opening scene sets the pace of the movie throughout which never lets up and some cases had me jumping out of my seat if you want a good fright - look no further - just remember these words ""Jeepers Creepers where did you get them peepers - you are about to find out?........"
BEST MUSIC!!,"I was in this play during the summer of 1998. I had a blast. I LOVE the music so much, I had to buy the CD. I listen to it almost every week. It just stays in my CD player."
the songs lack depth,"very weak, not a lot of effort, vocally or in production standards. She is losing her popularity here in Louisville. Monica has a lot of growing up to do, and she needs to portray a better image of herself, I dont know what happened to her voice. The First Night is not very conclusive, and I dont like her voice on Cross Da Room, WHAT HAPPENED TO HER? I dont understand why she is getting so much praise, and her songs, they arent all that. The only one i can stand is FOR YOU I WILL, i hope she changes her style, I guess its that plastic surgery on her acnoids which significantly reduced her nose size also affected her vocals."
Yum,If you're a fan of Sugar Blossom by Fresh you will love Archipelago's Brown Sugar and Vanilla line. It is a perfect companion.
"Who knew what ""BC"" meant in 1875 BC?","I read Many Lives Many Masters because of a comment made by John Steinbeck in his ""Travels with Charlie"" 35 years ago. He said something to the effect that if God would renew every leaf and blade of grass every year, why would he waste a human soul. I felt I was really going to enjoy Many Lives Many Masters and looked for validation of Steinbeck's remark. Then the author/psychiatrist takes the woman back in time and asks what year it is, and her response is ""1875 BC."" I would have believed perhaps ""3334 year of the dog"" or something like that. I can only assume that in the abridgement of the book for the tape, a definition of the time was simply converted to ""1875 BC."" The author lost all credibility for me with that one remark. I finished the tape but couldn't get past that. Plus I think if the author isn't an actor himself, he should hire one for the reading. It was very flat."
5 stars!!!!!!!!!!! well worth the money!!!!,"this compilation is a godsend for fans of 41st side snipers the imfamous mobb deep. the videos are to quality. the audio is awesome.this dvd leaves nothing to be desired, save the 2 mobb deep videos that are'nt on it."
Very Overrated,"This wasn't very good. It wasn't very interesting. There was no real merit or redeeming quality to any of the characters. It wasn't an awful movie, but it leaves you wondering why anybody would ever bother making it. Nothing really stands out as singular or intriguing."
"Great disk #1, one great tune on disk #2","Saint Saens is, in my opinion, one of classical music's more underappreciated composers. This CD set, especially the first disk, will tell you why.Piano concertos #2 and #4, both on the first disk, are, to my knowledge, Saint Saens' most famous works and deservedly so. Very melodic, memorable pieces. I've also found that piano concerto #1 is a real pleasure, though one with which I was less familiar before I bought this CD set.The second disk, featuring piano concertos #3 and #5, is less engaging, I think. Indeed, it's curious that the CD doesn't present the piano concertos in order. It's almost as if ""the good stuff"" was purposely put on the first disk.The exception is Saint Saens' inventive and creative African fantasy at the end of the second disk. This is a rousing piece of music that reminds me a lot of Gershwin. It's track #8 on the second disk if you want to jump right to it when you put in the second disk. That's what I find myself doing..."
Not Much History,"All in all an interesting read, however there is little in the way of actual history and anecdotes about this 'forgotten epidemic' - The book focuses far more on the modern day hunt for the virus than any sort of historical examination of what happened during the epidemic. An interesting read, however, people interested solely a historical examination of the virus should probably look elsewhere."
"Nice Color Plates, but......","The color plates are great, but the editing and accuracy of the rank charts is horrible. You would think they would have corrected their errors a long time ago."
"Works OK, Great Construction","The anchor is very well made, however you need to screw it down really really far in the sand. It has an extra set of blades on top that help with this."
"A dated, introspective, and irrelevant narrative.","There are works that are timeless and apply to any generation or society. This is not one of them. It certainly cites timeless works ad nauseam, but offers nothing new or insightful. References to dated social problems and terms do little to help this. The vast majority of the rest of the work seems to me to be a tour of the author's past, from his days as a ""Hipster"", to his early days as a psychotherapist, and several patients he has worked with in his career. All that said, I will be fair and say that there /may/ be 2 pages (or 1 page, 2 sides) of thought-provoking observations by the author. There is a certain disingenuous quality to a psychotherapist writing a book whose premise is that you need neither the psychotherapist nor the book in the first place. So why write it? It does happen to further the argument that there are no answers in books...Maybe that was the purpose in the first place."
this dvd is a disappointment,"I was anticipating the energy and charisma of a Live Journey concert. I couldn't find it anywhere on the DVD. Every song on the DVD was performed at what seems 1 1/2 speed. It seems the band was trying to quickly get through the hits that the fans came to see. There is little to enjoy as the band seems to not be having a good time performing their songs together. Play Stone In Love or Who's Crying Now and see for yourself how quickly they go from the intro to the end. This DVD is disappointing. Although Steve Perry produced this DVD, in no way is this a 5 star DVD."
great book,"Coe wove a masterpiece, moving away from the boring nal to spend more time with Jaryd and other bird mages. He impressed me because it does not seem as long winded as his previous books."
Ghost13,I really was suprised when i seen the movie. It scaried me out of my skin in the dark. But when he found his kids.
I love this carrier!,"I have a bad back and it's difficult to lift my cat in a carrier. I love this one because I can wheel it! The only down side is that the handle is a little short for me. I am 5.7"" But I still use it all the time!"
Broken Kindle,"My name is Alyce Buckley and about 18 months ago, I bought my daughter, Shawn Clark a Kindle at Amazon. A few weeks ago, she tried to use it and one corner on the upper right hand side is blocked out, therefore making reading impossible.Both she and myself spend a ton of money at Amazon with books, toys, and all of our gift shopping. I would imagine you only have a years warrantee on this item, but would hope an exception could be made to keep some good customers. A Kindle should last more than 18 months. Obviously, we cannot buy books with a non working Kindle.Please advise... I am writing this from her account - David & Shawn Clark - clarkx4@gmail.com My email address is bucko3200@aol.com.Thank you for your concern in this matter.Alyce Buckley"
a false story,"Too bad Sebastian Junger tried to tie his own mothers episodes with DiSalvo to Bessie Goldberg. It was a stretch saying that DiSalvo murdered Mrs. Goldberg when everyone knows it was Roy Smith. If Mr. Junger had told the true story , there would have been no ""journalstic"" book, because Junger got the facts all wrong. He got them wrong to write fiction and that is what a ""Death in Belmont"" is. Its pure fiction. Book stores are placing it in the wrong column."
Ashamed of Dewalt XRP batteries,"I was really proud to buy Dewalt's kit with drill, sawzall and light kit with two new XRP batteries that came with them 6 years ago. One of them lasted to about ten charge cycles and yes I did charge them right using the instructions provided for proper battery charging and discharging. The other one died before twenty charges.So I got these two and I'll be darned if these XRP's didn't die out on me within a few months. I took one of them to a battery store but the cost was too high to replace the sub c cells in it and the lady there told me that two were fried and that it is a common fault with these type of batteries.I'm going to sell my Dewalt stuff and get some other brand that comes with decent batteries. For the price of these batteries it is easier to lug around a corded tool anyway. It is too much to pay Dewalt for batteries that last so short."
help,I recently saw this gymn at the store and liked it for its versatility.The fact that it does not become completely useless after the first months really impressed me and the colors are bright and attractive.my only concern is whether the toys that hang down can hurt the baby?usually all playmats and gymn seem to have soft toys?please help
Case for Samsung SPH-A640 cell phone,"The case for Samsung SPH-A640 flip phone that I bought is sleek and fits the phone well. The design is good, case has two sections which can be put on each section of the flip phone separately. It appears durable. It is good value for money."
Disappointment,"When you hear the three singles, (""In My Place"", ""Clocks"", ""The Scientist"") you expect a masterpiece. But have you ever seen a trailer for a comedy film that looked great, but was disappointing because the trailer gave away all the funny parts? Same thing with this album. The three singles are worth it though. Just skip the rest of the generic filler."
Runs Out Of Steam After A While,"Me, Myself, and Irene is just a one trick pony movie. Yes, Jim Carey pulls off a few amusing scenes. After a while though it gets kind of redundant. How often can you stomache Carey jumping back and forth from an easy going loyal person to a vengeful creep.The plot is truly helter skelteras it seems as if at the last moment that decide to throw in the old double agent routine to make Carey look like the true good guy. Meanwhile, look at all the criminal acts that Carey participated in.The roles of the three African American sons at first is a bit comical. However this sidebar act wears thin with the rapid fire cursing. It is way too stereotypical.A few amusing scenes here and tehre but overall this is a dissapointment. Seek out The Mask or even The Truman Show as these are superior to the medicore Me, Myself, and Irene."
Tastes like trash,"This is a nice cheap product but you get what you pay for, the taste is TERRIBLE! Maybe one day I will try out a different flavor."
Rush Power Trio,"1.Sound- great but could have been DTS2.Image-Very, very good3. Venue - Great because not too big , not too small, therefore the sound is great4. The medley at the begining is amazing and the second one with XanaduCompared with RIO, In Germany the sound and image are betterbut the huge crowd in RIO is awesome, depends what you are looking for.Both are great."
improving,"v.2 of the software running with OS X tiger runs much better, without the freezes and failure to sleep etc. that plagued earlier versions. I plugged an old pair of headphones into the antenna jack and now get better reception & more stations than on my stereo, which has a 6' t-shaped wire antenna.I got this free for pledging on my local NPR station, and I'm not sure I would have paid the full price..."
lacked accuracy,The admissions standards potrayed in the book are the authors opinion. The book put out by the LSAC has most of the school's actual admission decisions.
To Win a War,"Jack Higgins drops the reader into the espionage world of WWII with COLD HARBOUR. The pace is fast and the mission is deadly for all concerned. Craig Osborne who has once been a prisoner of the Gestapo executes a Nazi and escapes back to England with the help of the beautiful Anne-Marie Trevaunce.Anne-Marie is the niece and heir to the Countess Hortense du Voincourt who's chateau has been convenscated by the German high command. Anne-Marie is ordered back to England where she is given a truth serum that goes horribly wrong. Her twin sister Genevieve is recruited to carry out her assignment.Great action and intelligence novel with a rapidly changing plot. Excellent read.Nash Black, SINS OF THE FATHERS."
Good upgrade over cheap basic ones,I use it for a step program at work. The memory feature is very nice since it allows me to avoid keeping a daily log of my steps. As long as I write down my steps at least once a week I never miss writing them down. You can always review the last 7 days of history.
would be perfect if.......,"API 645 Bird Bath Bowl with Tilt-to-Clean Deck Rail Mounting BracketIt would be a great birdbath if it were designed so that it can be mounted so as not to tilt over. I followed the directions to the letter, and it still wabbles all over the place. I even tried putting a brick under it to stablize it; it doesn't help. I will keep it because it's already on the deck, but barely. It seems others have had the same problem, I guess it all depends on the measurements of your deck railing or whatever you installing it to fit on. In my case, it doesn't work.Bought it thru Amazon."
Item has changed,"It didn't work for me because I couldn't hang the bag properly on my bedside because of the length(its length(from the the top of the handle to the bottom of the splashguard is a hair shy of 14"" long,length of the forked hanger on the top is less than 2"" on both sides. I also tried hanging the bag on my commode next to the bed and as the bag filled it slid off/dropped to the floor on me if it reached between 700 & 800 cc's because the distance between the top of the handle and the actual bag is over 2"",it would not support the weight when hanging off the commode-I will say that on a hospital bed the setup is probably Very good. I also could not hang it on my chair hook because the length would have it sitting on the floor of my foot rest."
no sparkle in this 'comic' mystery novel...,"After enjoying a few Laurence Shames novels, especially his wonderful 'Sunburn', 'Scavenger Reef' was a total disappointment. While the story has some promise (exposing the hijinx of art collectors and dealers) it winds up being very uneven, and an often a tiresome read. The characters are diverse yet completely unlikable, and I lost interest in the plot early on. Unlike his other books the magic and craziness of Key West doesn't shine through at all.Bottom line: a mess. Best avoided. Read 'Sunburn' instead."

Download it!Seriously every song is good.Throw a dart at the song list, listen to it, fall in love with it, repeat."
Johnny Tremain,"In the book ""Johnny Tremain,"" a young silversmith apprentice named Johnny Tremain in colonial Boston, 1773, is forced to leave his job after getting his right hand burned very, very badly. Luckily, Johnny finds a new job at The Boston Observer, a newspaper, delivering newspapers and secret messages to members of The Sons of Liberty, which is a secret patriot group that gathers at The Boston Observer.I gave this book two stars for about the first 200 pages were pretty dull. There was a little spark of excitement at about the 50th page. Then it was dull. Then there was another spark at page 200, and after that, it got quite exciting till the end. It left a very powerful message at the end: ""A man can stand up."" I thought it meant that you should be able to get out of whatever you get yourself into. If you want to find out your own opinion, read the book, then think about it."
Papo Triceratops,"I was a bit disappointed in the size, I expected it to be bigger. However, it is a very heavy dinosaur for its size. Good detail."
A 40-something female doctor living fully!,An Abundant Woman was available free at my local Curves. Elizabeth Walker's novel turned out to be a great gift. I became captivated by the unexpected unfolding of Amanda's insights as she continued to actualize her potential professionally and personally.
This book is too detailed,"This book is very difficult to read because it is not well-written and also because there are too many details. Furthermore, the author introduces so many characters in each chapter but never talks about them again later in the book. So it is difficult to determine who is important and who is not important.I find it impossible to believe that one reviewer found this book ""neither too skimpy nor too detailed."" How else do I know that this book is truly too detailed and inaccessible for most readers? One of the translators, Edward Wagner, concedes in another book (""Korea: Old and New"") that this book was, in fact, too detailed."
Dremel - Puppy Nail Trimmer,"What a great tool - I don't know why I had waited so long to purchase a dremel. I have not really used it as a real ""Tool"" as of yet, But it is great for trimming my one year old golden retriever, Cisco, nails. The variable speed is the best so not to tear his paws off, and the sound is not as loud on a low speed so it doesn't spook him.Now if he would only hold still . . ."
adorable,"I looked and looked for a crib bedding set and I couldn't find anything that cute as well as not very expensive. Then I found this set, it is adorable and not nearly as much as most crib sets. I just wish that Target had the whole collection. Love the set because it is inexpensive, cute and a good quality"
Xenon is much brighter than stock bulb!,"I ordered these replacement bulbs and was pleasantly surprised to receive Xenon bulbs; based on the main product picture, I was just expecting stock bulbs. I replaced the bulb in my Mini Mag and was again pleasantly surprised to see the difference in brightness! The Xenon bulbs are much brighter, and even slightly smaller. I have always preferred incandescent bulbs to LEDs. This flashlight has been going strong for over 20 years, and I expect it to last another 20 at least. $1.25 for a bulb that lasts 10+ years of occasional use? Good enough for me."
"Gets really hot, but sharp edges","I love using this for my backaches. It is difficult to use because the edges of te heart are very sharp and can really hurt. Its amazing how hot it gets and it feels great but I'm always a little tense when being massaged because I'm afraid of the sharp edges. Also, this is the second one I've owned, the first one popped when I boiled it for the first time.... dont know why. I didn't stab it or anything I just put it in the boiling water and realized it had popped when I pulled it out and it was half empty... anyways, its an okay product."
Amazing,"A few months ago, my choir had the amazing privelege of working with Penderecki himself on this fantastic piece. Since i had been under the impression that it was relitively atonal, i was simply blown away by this piece. THe way the choir and the orchestra work together is simply amazing. This is by far the best composition of the past century, and i would recommend it to anyone."
More Sex and The City than a Mystery,"If Looks Could Kill is an ok effort, but falls kind of flat on it&#65533;s face in the mystery department. Bailey Weggins is an appealing character, but the story itself does not hold up for her to shine. The book&#65533;s main problem is the fact that it&#65533;s not really centered on the mystery at hand but more on the nuances of the publishing world of magazines. Not to say that the magazine business is not an interesting topic but when it almost over shadows the story at hand, then there&#65533;s a problem.It&#65533;s an ok effort but it should have been better. I will though pick up the next book in the series to see if the Character of Bailey Weggins get a better story to shine in."
Very practical...,"This is a very useful and practical resource for designing interventions for reading problems in the schools. The book takes a very hands-on approach to designing these interventions, and takes you step-by-step through the process. Overall, it's a great book for school professionals."
"Chilling and thought provoking, excellent journalism.","If you liked The Perfect Storm, this one will haunt your dreams with its first-hand accounts of terror, tragedy, bravery, heroism, determination, good luck, bad luck, bad planning, and bad judgment. Mr. Farrington made me care about all these real people and their little boats out on a big ocean. It was all I could do not to flip ahead to find out what happened to them all, even though this all happened years ago. You may never take your own safety for granted again. Most of us are desperately unprepared for a real storm at sea. I found this book to be a riveting wake-up call. I'm on a mission to know a lot more about weather, radio, safety gear and emergency procedures. Both I and my 38-foot ketch are already better fitted for survival than we used to be."
XM Antenna headphones,The headphones work very well for hiking and listening to XM radio but the way they fit in the ears is not very comfortable.
pleasant surprise,"very nice looking watch, band fit perfectly,whole dial lights up with a push of a button, delivered as promised, great price"
Extraordinary recipes that are a delight to the palate.,"Full of unusual but consistently reliable recipes. This cookbook is now owned by many of my friends and my extended family. We get together and have Terrific Pacific potlucks several times a year. Although the recipes are sometimes complicated, their flavors are memorable. This cookbook makes a wonderful gift for the electic, experienced chef."
A MUST FOR YOUR LINCOLN BOOKSHELF!,"This book was obviously well researched. Steers fluently documents the series of events surrounding the Lincoln assasination. His telling of events is easy to follow. After reading this book, I have a better understanding of the people involved in the conspiracy and the roles they played in carrying out this tragic event in American history. This is definitely a book you want to buy for your Lincoln bookshelf. Steers paints a clear picture of the Lincoln assasination, however for a truly enjoyable companion read, I would suggest ""Lincoln Assasination"" by Swanson and Weinberg. The high quality photos in the Swanson/Weinberg book enhance your undersatnding of the events told by Steers. The two books bring the story to life!"
Completely innacurate,They should be giving this away. It has never been accurate. I've tested it against other thermometers to see if it was accurate/reliable. It always registers a signficant temperature when the temp. is actually normal. Not great when you're relying on this to determine whether or not to give your child medication.
"An essay, in book form","I've enjoyed Wendy Wasserstein's work, so I expected more from her. I THOUGHT I'd find some real humor. This little book is boring. A 300-word article would have been more than enough. It's not funny, not interesting, not entertaining, nor does it offer any real point. These ""books"" will probably be the sort of thing you give as a joke birthday/retirement gift, or ""collect"" yourself, just to have a ""set,"" thinking they might be ""worth something"" or ""meaningful"" someday. I kept hoping for the book to go from a dwaddle to a trot, but it was the same yawn. A cursory read, 10 minutes tops, is about all you'll need-- it continues as it begins, so no need to read more than a few pages. I doubt I'd follow-up with the other 6 sins if they lack the depth and wit of this one."
Very good old movie,"A friend recommended this movie, so I got it and watched it, enjoyed it and then sent it to him and he is enjoying it now."
Good but not for everyone,"When Gore is focused on something, like remembering his long lost love Jimmy or gossiping about the Kennedys this is a great read. When he is giving his thoughts and observations on history his writing also sparkles.His words on his mother are so bitter but I found it hilarious.When he tries very hard to explain locations and rattles off dates and names of people ony interesting to him this book is boring. I almost put it down but I am glad I didn't because towards the end some great dish awaits.I was touched by his longing for his lost love and he is humorous enough to forgive his high opinion of himself. (most of the time)"
not happy with it,i bought item and it was not as discribed it was very very aged not happy with it it was packed good but other than that not happy with discription.
Not Gone Enough,"Crime thrillers need some degree of believability. So how the police seem to be portrayed as dumb (as usual by Hollywood writers), in not believing a woman who says she escaped from a killer who placed her in a large hole dug in a forested area adjacent to a large city and where several other women were killed and the police perform no forensics such as examining dirt and other organic material; use search dogs or look for a pattern of missing women. They continue to be portrayed as dumb as she escapes multiple times from them pursuing her. It's not as if she's some ""Kick-Ass"" super person! So what gives? Really fragmented writing with little or no background on anyone from the killer, to the prey, to the newly hired detective who not coincidentally is portrayed as a jerk. Nothing creative in the story - same old victim escapes; is not credible to others; killer wants to finish the job; she finishes him. Acting was very good at being acting like - robotic and bland."
Pretty Bad,"Unless youre a huge fan of WW2 planes dont get this, i dont know what happened but if they spent some more time on this it couldve been decent.But they didnt from the begining it looks like they rushed this into production, i meen you can see the game drawing the lines while youre flying around, its pretty distracting, and the gameplay and story line is just as bad, n fact its so bad i dont even want to write any more about it."
Interesting insight into this family and what lead to there demise but handicapped by the lack of historical letters.,Many letters were destroyed by the family when they were coming under siege. Thus many assumptions were made and the depth of the story line somewhat hampered.
1/2 and 1/2,Not the best piece. One of the blades was very solid the other shakes and is not very sturdy.
Out with a bang!,"The show had a short shelf life but Season 4 got back to more of the gritty police cases mixed in with hot chicks. Season 3 seemed quite political with issues like homophobia, USA vs USSR, etc. It was a fitting end to the 70's seeing as shows like Magnum and Simon and Simon were more innovative and took over in the 80's."
Cut off the belt!,I cut off the weird belt... Now I can slip my own belt through the little slits put in the case (on either side) for headphone access. It is a bit fiddly but works fine. The case is nice and small (compared to other CD player carrying cases) and now I don't feel so conspicuous when I wear it.
Hysterical! This book will brighten anyone's day!,I couldn't put this book down! It was great fun to read and I highly recommend to women and men who want to understand the annoying things about being a woman!
Quilt book,Book came very damaged with the back cover cut clear across the back and the book was bend out of shape
Laura and Trent,"Well, i've always had mixed feelings about Ms. Rogers books. Mainly the scenes of brutality in them. But this book was lacking those scenes and quite frankly, while a nice change that the heroine wasnt gettting slapped around repeatdly of raped, i rather missed them.Trent and Laura are engaged early in life. But theres hardly any history between them other then that. I felt the book was a bit rushed and just lacking in ways. Laura was annoying at times, and Trent was a complete mystery for most of the book. Call me crazy, but i like a little of the male point of view, to at least know something. Its like we never do know what brought them together, even at the end."
The Best of Mozart Vol. 2,"Mozart is one of my favorite classical composers. I have both Vol. 1 and Vol. II in a 2 cd set. Volume 1 has Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, The Marriage of Figaro Overture, and Symphony No. 29 in A-Major.VOL. II1. Turkish March (Rondo Alla Turca) 3:322. Fantasy, D-Minor 4:563. The Magic Flute 8:594.

Very technical,"I'll buy anything to do with the Titanic, especially books, but I was really disappointed with this book. It's very technical, and not only takes into what happens during planning/filming Titanic, but goes into detail about the three years before it even begun filming. There's a lot of stuff about James Cameron's ""Abyss"", and there's really more detail than needed.It's a long hard slog to get through this book, and I wouldn't recommend it for Titanic fans out there. I'd recommend it to people who are interested in Titanic AND who are interested in the film making business. You could learn a lot from James Cameron."
il est peut-tre moi,"As the title states, maybe it's me. I really liked Amelie and A Very Long Engagement, but I just didn't find this movie that entertaining. I could not connect with any of the actors. Not sure what else to say.I love black comedy, I don't need to be spoon fed the story, but man, this movie was out there.So lesson learned: Take my own advice and rent the movie first. At the most it was a watchable film, but not one I'd add to my collection."
Nice Item. Company - not so much,"The mask itself is great. Warm, fits good, ventilates well and keeps moisture out. But the company took its dear sweet time in getting it to me. I placed the order 12/22 and it didnt ship until 1/12. The arrival estimate was 1/6 through 1/14, it arrived on 1/15. I probably could have found a store selling a similar item that functioned just as well and got it to me immediatly within that time period. During the winter months with this type of product; quick arrival is very important."
Sarah Noble,"Our class read The Courage of Sarah Noble. I liked this book for many reasons. I liked it when Sarah taught the Indian children how to speak English and the Indian children taught Sarah how to play Indian games. I also liked when Sarah stays with the Indian children while her dad goes to get the rest of the family. Last, I liked when the rest of Sarah's family lives with her at the end. I learned some interesting facts. I learned that the Indian children play different games than the English. I also learned that some Indians live in homes called wigwoms. Finally, I learned that Indians are not mean to the English. The Courage of Sarah Noble is an interesting book."
horse lovers,My daughter loves horses so I got her this game. It is fun but she gets tired of playing it fast
"""Night Ranger Is In Town"".","This is a great compilation CD, has a balanced combination of melodical soft rock/pop and hard rock songs. Their big hit, ""Sister Christian"" is gladly not alone but accompanied by powerful & beautiful other tracks icluding, ""Sing Me Away"", ""You Can Still Rock In America"", ""When You Close Your Eyes"", ""Sentimental Street"", ""Four In The Morning"" and ""I Did For Love"". As I came to like this band through their soft rock sounds, I'm not very comfortable with their hard rock moods in ""Don't Tell Me You Love Me"", ""Eddie's Comin' Out Tonight"" and ""Goodbye"". It's a highly recommended compilation by this talented hard rock band and they are really in town!"
Stunning documentary,This was a part of history I had never heard about before and I have studied a lot of WW2 history. It's an incredible story beautifully told. I fell in love with the survivors who told their stories with such unbelievable courage and raw honesty. I cried at the brutality but even more so for the beauty of these luminous souls who lived to tell about it. This is humanity at its darkest and at its brightest. I'm so grateful to everyone who brought this film into being. What a tragic loss if these men had died in silence.
great for what I need it for,"I bought this vacuum because I only have three small rooms with carpet to vacuum. The rest of the house is hardwood, although I'm sure I'll use it on the hardwood also. So far, so good. It picks up alot for a little vacuum. It is really light and easy to maneuver. It sure is noisy though! That's why I give it only four stars."
Doctors of the Church Snippets,"Unfortunately this only wet my appetite to read the whole book or article. etc. that the short few pages this book gave you of each Doctor of the Church. I was so disappointed I returned it as I wish to obtain and read those actual books, so in the long run it was God's way of showing me several of these Doctor's of the Church I was not aware of before, so I have to thank the author for writing it as now I have a whole new world of authors. God bless him!"
Carville is better,"For those who have been hornswoggled by Bill Bennet's insufferable moral superiority, I highly recommend James Carville's "". . . And the horse he rode in on. It's a devastating indictment against Grand Inquisitor Kenneth Starr. It's available on Amazon.com."
what up Gwen?,"I have always loved No Doubt and Gwen!~ I dont know what happened with this CD. The first single ""what you waiting for?"" Is really good. However the rest of the album doesnt compare. I love the idea that she wanted to do a whatever/dance CD. This isnt that! The producers are all reputable and good, but it sounds like a whiny, phony Gwen! I wanted to cry!!!! She has always had her own style and this CD shows strangulation! The album is filled with bubble gummy lyrics and synthetic sound and just isnt that good. Im sorry..."
Standard SD card,Seems to work as expected. Transfer speed seems a little low but it works fine with all of my cameras.
"Good, but tight","I weight around 190lbs, have been squatting for about a year. I got the medium sized ones since I'm under 250, and let me tell you...they're tight. I wish I would have listened to the other reviewer and ordered the large. Anyway...they fit, but they're tight - which makes them hard to put on."
Save your money... Complete flop,"I realize it is a kid's movie and I bought it for our 7 year old daughter. She loves Scooby Doo and had to have the new movie. Normally I see her busting a gut over Scooby, which she did with the Scooby-Doo/Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. She only laughed from time to time with this movie. Acting is horrible, the characters do not fit with the typical scooby characters. Why does Fred have brown hair? What is with the lovefest between the characters. Not mention I thought it was a Scooby movie, his role is not as big as one might believe.Please save your money but if you must see it, use Amazon Instant Videohttp://www.amazon.com/Scooby-Doo-Curse-Lake-Monster/dp/B004Q8K28C/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-video&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1299641838&sr;=1-1"
Kodak Digital Camera,The price was great for this digital camera at under $100. It has very good features for an inexpensive camera and will work well with the docking unit the recipient already has.
Poor Ending,"It took me a few chapters to get into the book, but then I was hooked. I couldn't put it down. When I finally read the ending, I was very disappointed. There is no sense of closure and the ending is totally unbelievable. I can't accept that the government would have gone through that much trouble to let them all walk off into the sunset with a bunch of money and no records. In the real world, they would have disappeared."
"A nostalgic, musical trip to the past.","This album is a culmination of the greatest groups that highlighted that colorful era of the early seventies. It serves as a ear-splitting catalyst for re-living those days when concert tickets to the best events were four dollars and the artists were ""real"".The recordings are of the best quality, and on a good system, you can feel the depth of the music - a sense of actually being there. Thank you, Bill Graham and everyone at Fillmore. I cherish the memories."
Great Tie Rack,"I read all the positive reviews before I bought this tie rack, and they may not have been effusive enough. First of all, it's a great tie rack. It's easy to organize the ties and move them around. The thing I really liked is that no matter what kind of closet set-up you have, you can install this -- and install it easily. The directions were so easy to follow, and there's not much assembly required. I'm really happy with this purchase."
socked in nothing else to watch.,Not his best work. Ended very abruptly and the only money theme was hard to find throughout the whole movie.
not a really big upgrade,I haven't changed my razor's head for over 3 years. I almost bought a new shaver but then I decided to try replacement heads. I was pretty excited after reading all of those great reviews. Disappointment came with the first shave.. I simply couldn't feel too much of a difference!
Great CD!,I'd heard so much about Paula Robison so I was really excited about getting this cd. I would recommend this to any serious flute player or music patron. Her interpretations of the Carmen Fantasy and the Dutilleux Sonatine are the definite highlights.
This was really easy to follow.,"I have been only been using Java for about a year. I tried a few other EJB books and frankly could not follow them. This book was very easy to follow. I have now created standard java beans, a few session beans, and a message bean.My only complaint, and this is a small one, is that I would have liked to have seen a few appendices explaining the various major application servers."
Why Was my Review Deleted?,"Mine was one of the earlier reviews posted for this book, noticing that there is only nine reviews here, it doesn't seem for want of space.perhaps it was because there were so many overwhelming negative reviews for this book and someone there felt the need to beef up the ratings?I also notice that a bogus anti-christian tirade from someone claiming to be author Nathaniel Merritt is still here, even though it looks like it isn't even him. You keep this goofy review but delete mine?"
The Games,"Just in time for 06 Winter Games comes a book that affords the reader a behind-the-scenes look at what it might be like off the ice and off the mountain. This romance spins more than just the stories of relationships. The Games interweaves the emotions of love, competition, betrayal and friendship as it tells the story of loves past and new against a backdrop of international competition.The tension experienced by the reader will not just be of the sexual variety between characters. I felt my pulse racing as the athletes I came to care about competed. The peeks inside the world of world-class competition will give the reader a new perspective on what it must be like when years of training and perseverance come down to one final game, four minutes on the ice or the steadiness of a hand.If you are a fan of the Olympics, this a must read. And if you read just for the romance, you will not be disappointed either.Jerilyn Willin"
"Beware the adage, ""You get what you pay for.""","I took a chance buying these, and wouldn't have if the favorable comments hadn't been as good as they were. I made a HUGE mistake. If you LOVE your music, these are not for you: while the highs and mid ranges are okay, the bass tones are almost nonexistent--don't look for full, rich sounds from these ear phones, because you won't get them. You really DO get what you pay for."
"... with an expected ""Twist""","Supposedly there is a twist to this film about who really isthe clone and a couple days after watching it, I could care less. Ireally like Arnold movies... but I was a bit disappointed with thisone. Even Robert Duvall couldn't make it impressive. It is yourtypical, bang bang shoot 'em up Arnold flick. To me it seems likethey wanted to make something that really throws you off, keeps youguessing all the while you say to yourself, maybe this could reallyhappen. ... thats it. But you really doget captivated by any of the characters. If you wanna see Arnold dothe same old thing shooting people and blowing ... up.... this isjust for you...."
stinky,"I bought the single dose packets so I didn't have to deal with measuring, but the packets smell like MAYONNAISE!! All I can think about is how unnatural it must be... so I think i will try buying the tube next time."
Basic analog clock,"This is a very basic analog clock. Thought it would be backlite...but rather it has a ""nite light"" at the 9 o'clock position...to show the hands."
cookie cutters,"A bit disappointed that they aren't a bit deeper other than that, for the price, they do the job. I was going to use them for rice krispee treats but they wouldn't work. They were not deep enough or sturdy enough. I won't keep them, will pass them on the my grandkids for fun."
Not big enough...,"This blanket is not big enough to swaddle a baby more than 8 weeks old. Also, the instructions that come with it aren't that helpful. Just get the swaddle designs blanket instead. It cost more money but is worth it. This is getting returned. I did give it three stars as it's nice and light and soft. Okay for a very young infant I suppose."
Kate's world,The whole work of Kate always inspired me: Since listening to the Hounds of Love I really get addicted to Kate's work and during the last ten years this unique masterpiece of music still moves me.
Buy a KitchenAid,"I have the 7 quart model, and the hinge is loose so that the top bounces quite significantly when mixing heavy dough. Today the dough hook separated from the threaded pin that is inserted into the mixer - the threads stripped on the cheap aluminum dough hook. I called Cuisinart, as while this is an obviously defective part / design, they essentially blew me off - 2 1/2 years after purchase - so ignore the purported better warranty....I have used KitchenAid mixers extensively in my culinary training, and in spite of their own issues, they are much sturdier, overheat less, bounce less, and I've had better warranty experience with them."
great all around brewing tips,"This book is not only great for brewing bock beer, I was amazed at the tips and information that I have never came across before. Read this book and you will brew better beer in all styles."
Who is Angelina Esparza?,"Before buying this I did my homework to see how it rated against Krush's former work. There was an array of opinions but most seemed to agree that ""Alethuo"" was the defining peice. This is definitely the case. Although I enjoyed the mystic depth of tracks such as ""Trihedron"" and ""Lost Voices"", ""Alethuo"" (Truthspeaking) took it to the next level with the compliment of the words and voice of Ms. Esparza. The meaning of DJ Krush's title ""The Message at Depth"" is revealed."
hate this chair!,I cannot stand this highchair! It was way to difficult to clean. The tray sits up to high for baby! I went with another one after using this one for 6 months!
New York Ballet Workout,"Fun video, the lighting is a bit dark so it makes it a little hard to see the dancers, but you really feel like you've had a good workout when your done, it targets all the little muscles to help you control your movements better."
"Looks cool, but bad machining","Beware, the price is cheap and you get what you pay for. The machining was so poor that there would be no way to get any accurate milling. I returned the item although the shipping was almost as expensive as the product. Kudos to the seller for refunding the item and their shipping. Bottom line - heavy junk, might work as a boat anchor."
Solid Quality,"Yes they are expensive but they make sense if you do a lot of flying in airplanes. They are comfortable even on a long flight. They are very quiet, because of the noise canceling feature and also because of the solid construction and the fact the phones go around your entire ear. They sound very nice for music and voice reproduction. The quality of materials and workmanship is very high, as you would expect with the price."
"An Introduction to a truly ""Magnificent Obsessesion""","This is a purported ""prequel"" to ""Magnficent Obsession"" which Douglas wrote earlier. He says in the introduction that he is writing in response to requests from many readers who wanted to know more of the motivation of Dr. Hudson. Unfortunately, Douglas either won't (or mare likely can't) say.Douglas was a generally Protestant minister, influenced by the mid-century liberalism of his time that caused him to approach the promise of Matthew 6:3-4, but then back away at the last moment. So, this book is disappointing. You expect that he will explicate the promise fictionally, but he never does.While he was popular with the undifferentiated liberal Protestantism of his time, his writing doesn't hold up well. The characters are wooden and the overall treatment of the Biblical premise unsatisfying.Go to the original -- any number of commentaries on Matthew 6:3-4. Douglas' pale reflection doesn't work."
This lens is BIG AND HEAVY!,"I bought this lens to use for children's portrait photography and quickly learned that it will not work simply because the lens is too big and heavy to use while chasing around a child. It also does not have images stabilization (IS). The Canon EF 24-105mm f/4 L IS USM Lens is much smaller, has IS, but has a wider aperture (f4 instead of 2.8) - a welcomed trade-off after my experience. The worst part is I had to pay $50 to return it to Amazon.com since it needed to be insured - and they don't reimburse you for that cost so my recommendation is to go to a camera shop and at least hold the lens in your hands before purchasing!"
WEB has lost his groove thing.,"I've bought my last WEB Griffin book after reading everything he wrote for many years. The Saboteurs confirms that his recent releases were not accidents, they were in fact terrible."
CONEY HATCH - THE BEST OF THREE C.D. !,"GREAT ROCK-N-ROLL ! THEIR SINGERS VOICE SOUNDS LIKE FOREIGNER/BAD COMPANY ! THE GUITAR RIFFS IN MY OPINION ARE BETTER THAN BOTH BANDS ! CHECK IT OUT, YOU WILL LIKE !"
WORDY,I found the wording a little difficult to follow especially the instructions under 05 with the circles etc. It is a good book but NOT the sort of Basic book I was expecting.IO will try to persevere but I am not finding it as simple as the author says it is as the instructions are not really clear.Paul D.
Could Have Been A Great One,"If Dylan had replaced ""When Teardrops Fall"" with ""Series of Dreams"" and ""Disease of Conceit"" with ""Dignity"", this would have been one of his best albums. Of course, if Dylan wasn't perverse and willful he wouldn't be Dylan. As it is the album's still very fine, with a few standout songs (particularly ""Man in the Long Coat""), great growly vocals and moody arrangements by Lanois."
MacVision MA823T-5W,"I just got my MacVision MP3 player and I've had no problems with it at all.I recommend this to anyone who would like to have an MP3 player but doesn't want to drop $100 on an IPOD. I fit 151 songs on mine before I ran out of space. It's pretty easy to use and the manual was helpful to me.Though the design is a little strange, it's a pretty sturdy little thing. My only complaint so far is that the display is a little hard to read unless you hold it right up to your face."
"Fast read, familiar story","I call books like this, ""the bridget jones books"". I read these between the heavier books I read. They follow the similar pattern of career girl in the city in search of love and sex, most don't quite live up to the calibre of the original ""bridget jones"", but they try.This book was a fast read and had some funny moments. The end is extremely far fetched. The story was not good, it was not bad, it was average. If you want a quick, mindless read, this book fits the bill."
Strong Debut!,"Just a great, bluesy, guitar driven rock n' roll album, and it makes for an impressive debut from Grand Funk Railroad.But, of course, the bluesy rock album has been done a thousand times, so it's not just those elements that make it successful. Grand Funk also include some funk (obviously), folk, and progressive elements in their music, and it makes for a wonderful mix."
Started on Fire!!,"DON'T but this hairdryer. I had mine for about a month when the retractable cord broke, button, spring and all... and then this afternoon I was drying my hair when it suddenly turned off and fire shot out of the cord and melted the plastic coating and started smoking. It was EXTREMELY startling and a huge hazard. Now I am sitting here with wet hair and looking up similar stories ... Please dont buy this product!"
Still Not Working After 48 Hours,"I have had it for two days now to try and give my pet treat when I am not home to keep them occupied. After 48 hours of loading the battery and filling the dishes, the thing has not move at all. The light is on and blinking and it was set to run every 12 hours. My pets can smell the treats inside and one wanted to start trying to force it open. If it doesn't open in 1 more day, I just may let him before I throw it out."
Song called CRY,"You CAN find the song CRY on the CD VH-1 Hits of the 80s. Their CD Crime and Punishment had some great tunes on it. Wish I could find the MP3 song, Crime and Punishment"
"Like the features, but speaker buzzed","I am a big online shopper and read reviews before I ever purchase. This radio had all the things I wanted. Seems rugged, like the features. Got it all set to go to a baseball game, and when I turned it on, even at very low volume, it had a speaker buzz. Checked quickly, nothing was loose. Happened on any station (AM or FM) that I tried. So it is going back. I will be looking for another Sangean model, since I have a number of their radios and really like them."
Uncomfortable,The earphones are not very comfortable and don't sit in my ear well. The original pair that come with the device are functionally much better.
Nice Watch,Have had the watch for some months now and had to take to the jeweler because it stopped and I thought maybe it might need a new battery. That was not the case. The jeweler said to keep an eye on it and bring back should it continue to do this. Only stopped working one time so far.
horrible!,"this is the most horrible deck since you have to sacrifice levia dragon-daedalus to summon your ocean dragon lord-neo daedalus. levia dragon-daedalus is the same thing as the ocean dragon lord, with 300 less attack. but it is easier to summon and it is much better. don't buy this horrible deck!"
Poor quality,I am trying to learn german and I am finding this software almost impossible to remember anything at all.They just start you right off with long sentences and nothing basic for the beginner.Avoid this product I wish I had researched more into what would help me learn another language. I give this three stars for the cultural activities that were fun.
Excellent overall philosophy of how to lead a good life.,Material in this excellent book breaks life into important aspects and gives insight on how to maximize your enjoyment in each. Shows how living a balanced life can lead to wellness and happiness. Gives some good practical advice.
Awful,I ordered this set as a gift. What I got was the small bottle of Joop. If I had enough time I would have sent it back. I paid for a gift set & got a single small bottle. This supplier seems to have a history of doing this. As I just read a review that said the same thing to that person. Why is this supplier still allowed to sell on Amazon?
Excellent,"Probably the best single resource I've ever seen about Army S.F., recommend to anyone interested in this field!"
It was moving,"This novel was an interesting novel. It moved me. It was so descriptive. It was so perfect the way that Barbara Kingsolver put the events and everything together. This book was funny, sad and nerve-wracking. The way Taylor and Turtle accepted each other so quickly showed that they both had trust in each other. This novel shows you the true meaning of love and true friendship. Unlike other books, this book catches your attention at all times. It is so far away from being boring."
Flowtron insect killer,"This bug killer is lightweight for easy installation, but it's very effectivekeeping down the mosquitoes at our rural home. Positionedseveral feet away from our entryway, it draws insectsto itself instead of them whooshing in the doorwhen we do. Fitted with the dawn to dusk attachment, it providesan outdoor light when we arrive home after dark. Very pleased withit and just ordered another for the barn."
Whats up with this?,"This book is great but what's up with the spelling? All the ""th"" words start with ""m"" so that looks like mat and then looks like men. Seriously amazon, what's up with that?"
great show,This is a great episode. Original story line and great acting - Love the outcome. Matt Passmore is so handsome!
Wouldn't work with solid Bamboo,"Silly me. I though all nailers allowed both 16 and 18 gauge cleats. Users recommend 18 gauge for solid 5/8 inch bamboo (Trillium) but manufacturer states either can be used. I tried 16 gauge and worked the compressor right up to 125lbs and it still wouldn't drive the cleats all the way in. I then bought the Bostitch MIIIFN on the advise from a Home Depot rep who told me it takes either. After the reading manual, it only takes the one Bostitch size which is 16 gauge. I tried it with the 16 gauge cleats. Using the recommended 3/8"" NPT, it drove the cleat way into the boards at 90lbs. I adjusted and settled at 50 Lbs to drive the cleats to the proper depth, at or a hair below flush. The Bostitch worked flawlessly and is really really built well. I'm about to finsh the rest of the house in a 3/4"" hand scraped oak and I'm sure the Bostitch will work great. It now comes with a set of shoes to accomodate most flooring thicknesses. I sold the Akuzuki."
A read not to pass up,"Infused with literary mastery, somber truths, delightful narrative and a study of the rediculous, this is a book that any serious reader of poetry would enjoy. It has the form of a dream state, with passive-aggressive surrealism similar to Dream Songs and some modernist literarature, such as Joyce and Beckett. When you read this book, you will be decoding a sort of dream-state disconnected from the world around you, though very much present in that deeper, darker, truer and sometimes more humorous reality of the unconscious.If you are looking for an intimate look into the nature of language, and a view into the mind and life of an author who breaks from traditional and pop poetry as he creates a work riddled with originality, I recommend this book. Happy reading!"
Not Very Good,"I only purchased this movie because I worked on the set when it was filming. There are some random scenes that are good, and John Krasinksi is great. But overall, very cliched, too long, poor quality, and boring."
Not a beginners helicopter,"Due to its larger size and power compared to the mCX, it is hard to keep this thing in the air and steady with it not either falling out of the sky due to not giving enough throttle or sky rocketing up. It is not heavy enough to resit the ground effects it causes so low hovering is hard to do without an extremely stead hand.Overall it is a fun step up from the Blade MCX. Responses are faster and the entire craft is more durable than the MCX. Fun to fly though flying inside may not be the best call if you are just starting out. You need plenty of room in all directions to deal with learning how to control these things."
too touchy feely,This book was too touchy feely for me and did not have much practical information that would result in real change.
don't waste your money,"The most this thing can handle is 2 sheets of paper... the motor on mine is dying and I haven't even had this for a week. It choked on 6 sheets of paper, and ever since the motor has been going nuts.I think the problem is a fundamental design problem with the shredder after looking at the bottom of it... the paper can jam on the side of the plastic creating unnecessary friction, thereby ruining the motor.Although this could be true of most shredders as well too. You get what you pay for.. Stay away from this one."
Very Bad,"These markers arrived in a box that was colored on, torn, and taped back together. The labels on the markers looked chewed on, and many of the caps were on the wrong markers."
Works... But Not Impressive,I have used several different types of Self-Groomers for back hair. This does cut hair but it's not very impressive and there is a lot of afterwork to do.
I would not recomend this product,The picture was great but the sound card is junk. It failed after only 3 months. The local retailer I purchased it fromhas also gone out of business.
"Great Flashlight, highly recommended",I bought this flashlight over a year ago after my last Streamlight (the regular stinger) got crushed. I use it every night that I work (law enforcement) and I have found that it is the brightest rechargeable out there.I can get the charge to last approx 4 to 5 nights of sporadic use and it will easily go for several hours of continuous use.Overall it was a great investment.
Pure Trash,"This is pure trash and a waste of your time but it is terrific, I'm sure, to people who are lost in this world."
Hideous,"I am sure this movie is very ""artsy"". I am just not able to comprehend its greatness.It is very hard to tell what is going on because of the spastic camera, spinning and focusing on the ceiling, then the floor, then the actor (almost) then the wall, etc. ad nauseam. Maybe this is a good film but I couldn't tell you because the camera work makes it incomprehensible. The spinning camera trick does mostly stop after 1/2 hour, but I decided at that point if I should watch the rest of the movie. It is full of allot of nauseating violence and gay sex. I couldn't see wasting more time on it, so I stopped watching."
Seems good,"Havent used for baby yet, will update with more useful review.There were NO instructions that came with the bassinet, took me way longer to put together than it should have. I also recommend getting a different mattress, the one that comes with the bassinet is JUNK. I reused my old bassinet mattress, which is way better than the flimsy piece this came with."
Great book! Fiction is a wonderful release!,I love this book and gave me a wonderful release From everyday life. The adventures Peretti took me on opened my eyes to a whole new kind of fiction and gave me something to think about. This book was amazing!!!! I loved the contrast between good and evil and the metaphors were mind blowing!
I had much higher expectations,"I was looking for a little bit more substance than this book provided. It seemed like all he was concerned about was including a few tips but filling this book with just simple, ""name dropping"". I'm not sure I took away a lot but it did inspire me to evaluate myself more in my quest to add to my rolodex. So, in summary, it was a good idea for a book, just doesn't deliver much."
Good lube. Not so good bottle.,"I bought this based on the favorable reviews I read here on Amazon. I only use my marker a few times each year, so I try to lubricate all the parts before playing and more importantly before long term storage.My relatively inexpensive Spyder semiauto performed well out of the box, but became a well oiled beast after breaking it down and lubricating the moving parts. In some ways the applicator tip is conservative, however it is blunt enough that it is difficult to get a perfect needle nose application. This is compounded by the fact that this stuff runs. It diffuses through your marker and will leak out of any crevices. However, this can be a good thing if you can mitigate excess oil. I would also note that I am using a polymer bolt (delrin maybe?) without any problems so far.This would be a five star item if it had a more precise applicator, and if they formulated this to be slightly thicker with less run."
Not Another Teeny Bopper Movie,"This movie surprised me. I expected something like She's All That, one of the better teen movies (to me)...or maybe something less than that. But this movie was not what I expected. It was fresh and funny! It made references to John Cougar Mellancamp and the storyline was unusual, absurb, and it worked. Good comedy. Not on my top ten list, but worth a viewing, in my book."
A Wonderful Reference but First Take a Class With a Live Instructor,"I use this book everyday, but in reading through the reviews I have to agree with the other reviewers who point out that in the beginning, you must have a live person with expertise to teach you the fundamentals. We moved and I lost my instructor (too far to commute to her classes), and I had already bought the book and then, because of my previous experience, The Pilates Body was perfect."
Good anime,"This is a decent series if you don't mind not knowing who wins in the end, or even who survives. This sort of makes it more interesting, but did annoy me a bit at first. In fairness, I haven't watched it in subtitles yet and that often makes a big difference. The story is good and an interesting concept, but not absolutely original. There are some thought provoking ideas, but it also has light entertainment, some comedy, and fan service. It is mostly sci-fi based. I would recommend it as a good series for a short evening, as there are only 3 episodes. I do not regret picking it up at all."
terrible,It was just a terrible movie. Very plain and boring. I suggest viewers to watch any of the x-men episodes instead.
From AA to Zeitgeist,"This is a remarkably wise book, whatever your spiritual history. From Desert Fathers and Thomas Merton to the Tao Te Ching, its scope is broad and charged with a vision of understanding that stands at the base of any effort to the growth of the soul through the five indices: prayer, observance, disciline, thought and action."
Gshifflett,What a wonderful book! I loved the parts which we've enjoyed in the movie and enjoyed the additions in print which the movie doesn't contain.
X-Men Legends,"First, I would like to say that this game cannot be played on an Xbox 360. I didn't realize that until I had already bought it. So if anyone does not have their old original Xbox do not buy this game.This game is a ton of fun though. I love a good co-op video game to share with my brother, friends, and my wife. It is something we can bond over and have a good time playing. When I originally played this game with my little brother we had a great time with this game and spent many hours playing through it on co-op. I recommend this game to anyone who has an Xbox and enjoys co-op games. This one keeps everyone having a good time all the way through."
Why is straight sex so boring?,"This series would have been a lot better if at least one of the lead couples had been gay. Straight people in real life are not much more boring than gay people are, but in most movies and on TV they are so shallow, dull and predictable that watching them do anything - especially have sex - is a big yawn. I found myself wishing for more of the therapy sessions with Jane Alexander, just because she is such a delight. This is not the worst thing I have ever seen, but it is hard to get through if you are gay. It was for me, anyway."
Perfect!,"I needed a solution to getting all my laundry products off my dryer (what a mess!). I made the big mistake of ordering an organizer much like this one but made of basically thick cardboard. (I did not order it from Amazon). If it hadn't fallen apart while being put together, it would have been useless anyway -- it would never be strong enough to hold laundry products. So in frustration I came to Amazon, saw this metal organizer, ordered it and am so pleased!!! It's great quality and holds everything. No more mess!"
One of a Kind!,This CD is Priceless. There are few musician's around today who can weave notes into such awesome dance grooves and melodic ballads. I miss his style.
"Good book, but they muck up a lot don't they?","This book is reasonably well written and details about the US Special Forces unit Delta Force. Overall it is a good account, but I have to say, having read many accounts of the SAS (Bravo Two Zero, Eye of the Storm...) they sound to be the better group of soldiers. Delta Force seem to muck up... a lot........"
1st one was better,They tried to make this movie grittier than the original which they accomplished but much was lost in character development. The special effects were cool but the story 'retold' could have been better.
Not Worth $100 Maybe $20,Much Errata in this book. Many concepts are just not explained in terms that can be understood. More effort was spent on marketing and cover design then content and proof reading.
A Coming of Age Story?,"When I finished reading this book I really didn't know what to think of it. While reading it I constantly felt like I was reading a trashy romance novel with all the explicitly sexual imagery and at other times I found myself wondering if the plot was going to go anywhere at all. The book is described as being a coming of age story of two best friends, but I think it is just a teenage pornographic novel. I probably won't read this book again and even though it was only two hundred pages long, I feel that my time was wasted on this unsatisfying book."
Merely going through the motions,"2 1/2This sounds like a pretty bland outing of country-rock for me, especially given Dylan's songwriting abilities around that exceptional time period. While most songs are competent enough to satisfy small expectations, a distinct feeling of the artist on autopilot lingers throughout, even if that pilot is the exceedingly talented singer-songwriter."
DEEP IMPACT GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS NOT SO GOOD SUBPLOTS,"I both saw DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON on viedo and I liked ARMAGEDDON better than DEEP IMPACT and here's why. I found that DEEP IMPACT focused too much on soap opera diaolouges such as the story of ELIJHA""S WOOD""S character and TEA LEONI""S as well. I felt that those subplots took away a lot from the fantastic special effects in the movie. Another thing I found unbelivable was that if scientists knew a mile high TIDAL WAVE was heading twoard the coast of the eastern seaboard. I would hope that they and our goverment would do everything possible to move people out of harm's way. Anyway I liked DEEP IMPACT for it's effects not it's story I kinda wished it was more like ARMAGEDDON instead foucsing more on action on action not soap opera subplots."
Delorme Has Gone Downhill,"I recently went to buy several new Delorme Atlases (for a few different states) because my old ones are getting a bit long in the tooth. Well, I left the store without them. I'm glad I didn't order them here because they would have been sent right back. The newest versions are simply zoomed-in highway/road maps. I can get the same info at the gas station for a dollar and have 70 less pages of nothing to carry around. There are no elevation contours, half the details are gone, and the format is generally 'dumbed down.' These maps used to show all sorts of interesting things for those who ventured off the main roads. The new ones show major roads, pretty colors, and generally which Interstate takes you to the national forests. If you're cruising the Interstates and are looking for the triple latte of highway maps, you're set. Otherwise... worthless.Sorry, but Delorme REALLY blew it. They need to rehire the cartographers and fire the graphic artists."
Save your money,"The less said about this grim tome the better. The whole idea of publishing with Doubleday is an attempt at mainstreaming the entire LDS corporation.Joseph Smith, the author of the book, was 170 years too early. He too tried to sell the copyright of the book."
Almost perfect,"I love this cover case for my Treo 680, it's got good grip, is not bulky, and doesn't interfere with the keys like other cases do. The only flaw is that it blocks access to the SD card slot. It looks like it was designed for a slightly different model (not sure which) but while all the other holes match up perfectly for the camera eye and speakers and charger access, the SD slot hole is way off. Also, the stylus is a bit tough to get out, but not impossible."
Pleased,I haven't opened the package yet because its a gift but this dish set looks like it was very nice quality and worth the $ I paid.
A wrong one have been shipped,"I ordered a Stereo Adaptor, but I received a Mono one. It is not the same thing which on the picture.Also, it looks very cheap."
Great product!,"I am so glad someone makes a non-toxic lice killing shampoo! At first I used the RID stuff on my two-yr-old, then found out it has more pesticide than what people spray in the yard to kill bugs. (And we were putting it on our heads!?!) I then bought this gel for the second treatment. They shipped it fast and I was grateful. It worked - we had a bad case and are now free of lice! I also recommend the spray (sold separately) for mattresses, strollers, car seats, but you'll want a lot b/c the bottle goes fast. If you need to save $ I heard vinegar kills lice - my friend shampooed with that - you might try it. I used this gel, though and was very pleased. The comb is a nice one, too. They have a hotline (printed on the bottle 1-800-itching) that you can call with questions, which I used and they were very helpful."
Good Ole Fashion Gangsta,"Wesley and Lawrence (Larry) brought back some flava to the ride 'em , stick up movies. Along with NJC, SH, and DU- man is HIPHOP wonderful or what?Anyway, hopefully the next genre of...will have an IMPACT the way this ONE did!Y2K1"
Weirdly obsessed with eliminating fat,"This maybe should have been advertised as a Susan Powder-esque eliminate all traces of fat from your diet cookbook. Squeezing your cooked dinner between paper towels to eliminate all vestiges of fat?!? Really?!? Every recipe with dairy uses non-fat yogurt and fat free half and half instead of whatever dairy product would ordinarily be used, and EVERY recipe lectures on all the ways you can take out every last smidge of fat. The author comes across as having an eating disorder, and the recipes are weird as a result. Some of them I can't even imagine working (for example, making split pea soup with split peas that you grind to a powder in your blender and bake with no liquid at all for an hour!). I bought this book because I'm currently without an oven and am committed to cooking fresh, from scratch food, and was looking for some ideas to stretch out from what I've been making in my toaster oven so far. I can't honestly see making any of these recipes."
5 Previews? No way I'll buy this one.,"Hearty THANKS to 'J. Wardell's' warning about the forced 5 previews before this otherwise fantastic movie! The Producers is great but I will pass on buying this one and it's gone from my wishlist now!I absolutely despise being FORCED to sit through useless previews of hack-job garbage just to watch my purchased movie. That's the whole reason we buy dvds here: We were not, are NOT, and will not be interested in Hollywierd's opinion is of what trendy drek we should watch. (And when was the last time they made a decent movie?... yeah, that's why we're all here buying OLD dvds.)The movie gets a 4.The forced previews get a minus infinity on ANY dvd."
20 stars for this phone!,"I LOVE this phone! I work on the phone a great deal and have tried them all. This phone outperforms even the $200+ phones I have bought in the past. An extra battery pack comes with the phone, and is kept constantly recharged, so you always have a fresh battery available. The headset is a substantial one, the best I have used yet. Many of the others consist of no more than a piece that slips over your ear, but this is a solid headpiece that is extremely comfortable to wear. The best part of all is that the caller id is built into the wireless phone, so that when you are away from the base you can still see who is calling, even when you are on the phone. I highly recommend this phone."
Not what I expected,"I bought this game because I was looking for a game my boyfriend and I could play co-op, and I was really disappointed by it. We both love the other RE games and I figured this one would be similar to the rest. I was WRONG. While it did allow us to play co-op, the game also moves you along on its own. You follow a set path and shoot, but you have little control over the speed of movement or the direction your characters will go. It makes it difficult to pick up items on the way, and there were several times when I'd be stuck in one direction while a zombie was chewing on my shoulder behind me - I'd have to wait for the game to turn me around before I could shoot the bugger. To me, having control over my characters' movements is a big plus. I am going to give this game another try after I get a zapper, hoping that the game will get at least a little better as we continue through."

travel Jumble,I haven't received yea don't know. I'm buying from you because the woman I care for is 97 yrs old and loves doing these. I want to get new ones all the time.
disappointing,"I was disappointed that the book i ordered had several watermarks on the cover where someone had used it as a coaster. This was not included in the description. I don't buy a lot of book on line, so maybe this is typical for books rated ""good"", but it was disappointing none the less."
Live performance quality,"Quality of the live performances not naturally as polished as studio recordings. I have the ""studio"" version of many songs in this CD and got used to its better quality so was unable to appreciate this live CD as much."
Me again.,Btw: so what if they signed to a major label: is that really that wrong that they went to a place that has 1. better recording quality 2. pays them a crapload more than an indie label and 3. has a BIG producer pushing them to the max? No. It's not wrong at all.
Uggh,"Yes, yes the movie was bad, really bad, so bad that if Homer was still alive to see it, he would be doing something similar to the TV that Mr. N does when he watches Boston Public. But how bad it was is beside the point. Who really cares if some of the people in our class are writing Mr. N's ideas on here. If I were him, I would be flattered to know that people beleived strongly enough in my ideas to take the time to write about it on amazon.com. To everyone who wrote a review on this horrific movie, and didnt criticize other people's reviews, good for you. I hope in the future we can all express our disgust with this movie without having our competency as an honors student questioned by someone who won't even tell us who they are. But until then, Lizzie Mcguire is on (hehehe) so I must be going. I'll see you all periods 1/2. - Andrew"
"it is so small, like a toy","I thought it would be a watch with a large panel for men, actually, it has a small one suitable for young boys.a compact design, not used to the small panel."
A pretty mess,"The slick CG fight scenes aren't enough to pull off this anime. The story is a mess. It is incoherent and jumps all over the place. It's all mood with no substance. I don't care about the ""brooding"" Karas character or the other wannabe ultra cool characters who walk around aloof like rejects from a James Dean audition. Save yourself some time and get something with originality, story and characters (like Ghost in the Shell, Paprika, Akira or Porco Roso) rather than a pitiful patchwork of rip offs that Karas is."
Weezer ...Make Believe....not good,"Make Believe has a few catchy hooks, but Rivers seems to try and go a little darker on the musical and lyrical side. It doesn't work for this band. They are more of a pop band than anything.I really like the Blue, Green and Pinkerton albums. This album is definitely battling with Maladroit as Weezer's worst album. It's too bad because I really want to like it.It doesn't offer much for the listener. Maybe they should start writing songs as a band and not let Rivers have so much control."
Haiti is better than what the author had writen in his book.,"First of all your ideas are not well founded since you did not live in Haiti long enough to place a judgement or an opinion.Your grounds are very weak when you see only one part of Haiti. Being like a horse on a race track, the author is only focusing on what you may consider the worst, I would like to know when writters are going to start publishing the right stuff about a third world country."
Wow!!!!!!!!!,"Read it! It teaches you how to make money, drinks, friends and alot more. Even if you dont think you need help on growing up, Read it and you will be the best possible! girl ever!!"
Didnt work out for me,"They gave me a rash, I never has this issue so I am not sure what material they are made of. I will be returning them."
Kurt Wallander's debut,"First a thank you to Amazon reviewers who praised this book so highly over the years. I bought the book on your recommendations and I was not disappointed. This is a fine police procedural with totally Swedish sensibilities. The place, climate and society are skillfully invoked by author Henning Mankell. Comparing ""Faceless Killers"" to later Wallender stories, you are even more impressed at the consistency of the writing and how the protagonist seems to spring fully formed in the first book. Read the latest (""last"") Wallander book and you find the same brooding, troubled, principled and intelligent character still struggling with his doubts and personal weaknesses.This is a fine mystery and very entertaining reading. Highly recommended."
Terrible phone,"This phone was so great IN THE PACKAGE. We bought it, took it home, and opened it for our little girl. Much to our disliking, it was TOO quiet. Our daughter couldn't even hear it, let alone us. It was a complete waste of money. If it was just louder, it would have been a great phone. Save your money, I recommend Fisher Price's Laugh and Learn Home Phone, so much more worth the money."
disappointing,"arrived in time, but in a very bad condition. the book was desecribed as ""used-good"" but in fact it was not acceptable, the cover is damaged and marked by a chewing-gum. really disappointed"
Enjoyable,"A very interesting overview of money and currency from a historical and anthropological perspective. The book's only flaw is the author's advocacy of out-dated mercantilistic theories regarding the gold standard. However, I certainly agree with his premise that the socialization of risk has led to the increased inflation of housing and financial assets."
What are they thinking?,"Anyone hoping for a conforming set can ALREADY forget it! Only season three and they CHANGED the packaging. So the sets are overpriced, only half a season, VERY slow to be released and, now, they don't even match each other!"
Preety and nice sound,"it has a really nice sound but not much volume, but i think that for the price and size its an excelent buy."
Better looking but poorer vacuum than the alternatives,"I bought this, although I already had the Vacuvin vacuum pump, because it looked more durable and easier to use. It IS nicer looking than the white plastic vacuvin (although it's grey plastic not metal), but it takes more pumps to create a vacuum and the vacuum is much weaker than with the vacuvin. since the metrokane is also twice as expensive, you'd be better off buying the vacuvin."
Seems to be good quality but hard to be sure,"Nice, heavy, quality pan. However, I didn't realize it was made in China, and this made me really concerned about the quality of the seasoning (who know what they used to pre-season it). The box looked really cheesy and cheap and had a typo right on it (unlike my Lodge cast iron, which was impressive in every way). The Sante website is pretty vague as well. I did call the company to inquire about the seasoning and they seemed to have good customer service and assured me that it was a vegetable oil based seasoning. Overall I think this pan is adequate and produced a nice pizza crust, but I would recommend another American-made brand first like Lodge."
Heroes Season 1 DVD,I'd never watched it before on tv but I'd heard how great the show was so I decided to buy the DVD set. At first it was a little slow but it gets very good after the first few episodes. I highly recommend it!
ABYSMALLY PAINFUL AND HORRIBLE 3 OUT OF 10,"THIS GOLFING GAME SUCKS SO BAD IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY HOW BAD IT IS. The basic mechanics don't even work properly, and will only piss you off because of how improperly balanced the controls are. For example: when hitting the ball you will notice how the ball always seems to get carried to an area far away from the area you intended it to go. You don't want to know how many times it will take you to get the ball even close to the hole. You will get stuck trying to get your golf ball out of sand traps and so many other places you will be left extremely pissed and agitated at this game. It's really not worth anyone's purchase unless you enjoy crappy sports games, go buy modern sports games instead, because most of the old ones like this one suck extremely bad. Don't buy it, whatever you do, because it's Hell's golf game."
Collar truly works,We bought this collar to shut our yippy little Sheltie from constant noise making. The first few barks and resulting corrections surprised her so much she now knows that if we put the collar on her that she doesn't want to bark and life is much quieter now. Even suggesting that we put her collar on now has an effect! My only concern would be that the correction could be a bit too strong for more sensitive dogs. The instructional dvd was very nice to have instead of just paper instructions.
pretty good prequel,"After reading other reviews of this movie, I decided to rent the DVD. It is a very cute movie! Usually sequels are kinda lame and never are as good as the original movie, but this prequel was good- I enjoyed it right along with my kids- ages 10, 6, almost 4 and 2. I especially liked that it had kid charcters that respected and obeyed their parents - ""yes m'am"" which is how my children are instructed to respond to any adult. I would consider buying this movie and I don't usually buy sequels. Happy viewing!!"
Questionning the Basis,"A really slow-motioned biographical picture on less known outside Spanish-speaking sphere historical figures of the pre-Rembrandt 17th century world, broadens viewer's knowledge with depicting a gloomy dangerous existence in absolute monarchy-ruled places outside more described then England/France, from a time perspective questions very grounds of a moral and ethics based on traditional values.Rather educative than entertaining work."
Don't be without them,easy to use and works well. Have not had to use it yet but from past experoence I know it will work well
Carstairs Review Followup,"A year or so back, I had the pleasure of contacting and receiving communications from Herman Hitson, who is now living in Georgia, but not yet retired. We discussed his new music and some latter day ventures, but I couldn't resist asking about the old days with Jimi. As Mr.Carstairs proclaims, those sessions in question indeed were Jimi and Herman jamming in 1966. Herman remembers every note, and a story attached to each."
Exciting and Thought Provoking,"All the history you need to know about the UFO Phenomenon without any speculation or craziness. Factual and Objective, Eerily Realistic, An Eye Opening read which gives insight into the our everyday existence and provokes the question - Why?Basically all the great UFO sitings and the governments response(s) from 1941-1973. There's also a little bit on what else the military was up to, as it corresponds to how they keep their secrets, and from the evidence they keep many.Also Highly Reccomended is ""The High Strangeness: Densities, Dimensions and the Process of Alien Abduction"" and ""The Secret History of the World"". Available from [...]"
Waxy and tough,"I'd read the ratings on this product, and expected it to be delicious. It was instead, waxy and tough. I won't buy it again."
Meh,"Some songs are accurate, but only some. I checked the book for a copywriter note. There was not one to be found. I guess they didn't want to pay the royalties for the Beatles music so they stuck together notes that are in the ball park."
Good item - worth the money -,I bought these spring perches for a project I'm building - the explanation of this item had me to understand that the price of these were 'per piece' but the price is 'per pair' - so I bought 2 pair instead of 2 parts - and the price was still good at that - I'll keep the extra pair - heavy duty and recommended -
Not Luxurious enough,"My mistake. It takes a long time to heat up. When it finally does heat up it is too hot. The tub is smaller than I thought. It's okay, but would've bought a bigger one, where the wax melted, but not steaming.Maybe they could use these comments for the next model."
Fun!,"This movie, starring Adam West and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin, kept up with the 1960's campy version of the series it spun off from, and was just plain fun to watch.I purchased this movie for the purpose of reviewing it for Classic Cinema Online, as I'm comparing live action Batman from the 1940's to the present, and am enjoying their many differences. This movie, as cheesy as it is, fits right in - no disappointments here!Of all the Batmans, this one makes for the best family entertainment, being suitable for children of all ages, and I highly recommend it because of how fun it is to watch.I ordered this new and it arrived on the day anticipated in excellent condition."
Love Brian but this is a DUD,"We are big fans, on his specail pre-buy anything you come out with list on the fan website. Just watched 'Standing Up' - it's a dud. I'd pass if I were you.I'd measure it by saying its less than half of a new set of material."
Nice to have,"Also need an audio meter to use the audio setup--I think of myself as an audiophile, have an aperion audio 7.1 system, with a high end onkyo receiver.The onlyo does not have an automatic tuning system, so I need to configure the levels for the speakers manually.So I have used this DVD to set it upI liked the audio setup. I re-do the tuneup every few months.You can really feel the difference before/after. 5 stars here.--I've also used the video setup, to tune the colors of my HD TV, but often go back to the TVs own settings.The ""custom"" setting I create help only for some movies.But the TV's dynamic mode, seems best for a majorty of shows/movies. 4 stars here.---As other readers said, very,very difficult to navigate. I found the easiest way is to go back to main menu and then navigate. 2 stars here---Still a good DVD to have.--"
Great organizer,"Love it. My broom closet has never been more organized. It keeps broom, swifter, etc off the floor. Leaves floor room for other things. Easy to install. Would recommend."
Dryer Sheets,"The product is OK, but to me it's just too much work. I'll continue taking my clothes to the dry cleaners."
Halloween reinvented,"I've been a fan of John Carpenter's Halloween for several years now, and a love for the film's classic score goes hand in hand with that. Here, the music is reinvented and modernized, and creepy new themes are also introduced. Plus, we get Mr. Sandman, the song that is probably more ascossiated with the Halloween series than any other. More great music for Halloween night."
avoid this one,"I was really looking forward to this toy, but it is quite a disappointment. Just getting through the maze-like packaging is a daunting task, which in my case required boxcutters and scissors over the course of a half-hour. Once you have the toy out, you find that notwithstanding the high-quality materials, it is badly designed. Parts of the toy keep popping out of place, and some of the joints are jammed so that transforming becomes an act of both strength and frustration. All the vaunted battery does is light up a little LED--not very exciting. The moving mouth effect is cute, but besides the nice die-cast metal, that's about the only good thing there is. The price is outrageous for what you get. Give me the original G1 over this hunk 'o junk anyday--I'm sending this one back."
For class I took.,Ordered for a class and it was a good use for info and research on what was required for the teacher.
"scenic, but dull","has little dialogue, but beautifully scenic. slow and peaceful to watch... for those looking for any kind of action, this is not the movie for you."
"making, shaping and treating of steel","The outside picture of this book is different when you click inside and also the content is 10th edition content, yes there is a notice but it popped up very quick and then disappear before you noticed it.And i made wrong order because of this.What i want is edition 10th as per the content but delivered was 11th edition.I suggest Amazon to update the content of the book all the time to avoid confusion and wrong orderThank you"
not impressed - not for dog owners,"After i opened the flick and easily assembled it I put it right to use. After a couple of ""sweeps"" I knew I had been suckered. I have 2 dogs and the Flick just pushed the hair into a nice little pile - which was easier for me to pick up than before, but that's not the point. After sweeping my Living room I had pile lines of dog hair everywhere and the cartridge was partially covered in other stuff. It's good to let my son use while I lug out the good ol' vacuum cleaner. It did pick up stuff I didn't think it would, but still not impressed."
"Good Looking Phone, Bad Battery","I bought this phone about a year ago and in a few months started having problems with the battery. It simply would not hold charge for more than a hour. Recently it got worse, so I got a brand new 1000 mAH battery and surprisingly still have the same problem. There is some inherent problem with the charging operation of this phone. My advise is - avoid VTECH phones if possible."
don't miss the book,"A real classic for sure. It's well worth it to read the book first. The story is of far more substance than the movie portrays, but the movie is a wonderful little sketch comedy and vignette with amazing artwork, animation and music."
What My Mother Doesn't Know,"I would highly recommend this book to all young female readers. This book is so easy to relate to that it makes reading it almost like a walk down memory lane. The events are so realistic and so typical that the book is great for adults too. Being completely written in poem format, makes the reading even more interesting."
Where are these guys?!?,"I bought this CD awhile ago after I saw them at the House of Blues show. Although I thought their CD doesn't do justice to their stellar live performance, I really enjoyed the CD. I am a big fan of track 6 which has a great 70's funk feel.However, since House of Blues I haven't heard or seen these guys anywhere? I hope they are still playing because their sound rocks"
Pretty good book,"This was the first Mary Higgins Clark book I ever read. I must say I enjoyed it. Daddy's Little Girl is about a 15 year old girl named Andrea who is brutally murdered and the man convicted (who maintaines his innocence throughout) is sent to prison. 23 years later he is released from prison and Andreas sister, Ellie (who was 7 at the time of the murder) tries to stop him getting out and does research on his past to prove that he is guilty of the murder of her sister. Suspenseful, good read. I was pleasantly surprised on my first MHC book."
It was a great book!!,I think this book is a very cool book! At first though it was sort of boring but then it got very intrusting and turned out great! I like reading wierd books like this one!
Flimsy packaging,Primary packaging is pretty flimsy. (lightweight cardboard) The overpack (wadded up paper) was effective though because no broken sticks!
"Yousef and Al Quaeda, not Saddam","Jayna Davis provides compelling OKC bombing connections to between Timothy McVeigh, John Doe #2 who Davis identifies as Hussein Al Husseini, and ultimately Ramsi Yousef. Unfortunately, in a few pages, Davis abandons reason and objectivity, and wrongly concludes that Saddam was behind the bombing. The only evidence provided is that Al Husseini was a former Iraqi Republican Guard soldier. With that logic we can tie any U.S. president to the bombing, since McVeigh was also former military. Despite this flaw, there is enough detailed investigative reporting here to conclude McVeigh colluded with at least some middle extremists to produce the worst terrorist attack at that time on our soil. It is unfortunate that persons hang on to the poorest formed conclusions to advance their Saddam is behind all evil theory. If only ten years ago some of that paranoia was directed at Yousef and Al Quaeda..."
GOOD BLADE MY FOOT!!!!,"I dont have this blsde but my friend does. He thought it looked cool and so did I but it stinks! He barely battled with it and the tip broke off! it became so useless he doesn""t even keep in his storage box anymore. Oh and the kid who said it broke that weight disk is definitly exasurating Bump king couldnt break anything. It may be called the King but it isn""t."
Good price for scale.. does what I need it to.,"Great little scale that I can put in my bag and go with. It uses regular batteries so no need to add it to the piles of other small electronics I no longer use because I need a specific type of battery. Even though I did not purchase a calibration device to go with it, I just used a penny to calibrate it and everything worked fine. Just remember that when using the lid for a tray to adjust accordingly on scale. For less than ten dollars, I have a scale that I that works just as well as other models. It was cheaper than most models of its type at my local brick and mortar store and even some other online retailers."
my dog tore it up fast,It was a alright toy for the price my dog liked it she tore it up in two days ow well
"Personally, this CD kicks.",Of the two Timbaland (Tim) is my favorite. On the contrary Magoo (Maganoo)'s voice is the better of the two. The CD is great.
Do NOT order it here because you won't get any magazines.,"I ordered this magazine a year ago, and my nephew still haven't receive a single magazine! Every time I email customer service they would tell me that it's coming next month. I will let you how the magazine is when I get it, but don't hold your breath."
Not so natural,"I despise companies and brands that use the words ""Natural"" and ""Eco-Friendly"" to try and lure people into purchases. From the description, it seems none of this product is sustainably crafted or produced with any environmentally friendly standards. Exploiting peoples care for the environment is ridiculous, stop it."
a little much for the typical reader,"Having grown up in the Chicago suburbs and been in high school during the gangster-rap glory years, I was only exposed to the fantasy-end of pimp culture in music videos, etc. Iceberg Slim is not the pimp of the type shown on MTV - this story is full of desperation and regret. There is a real pathological hatred of women that plays out in Slim's foul treatment of his prostitutes. Homo-eroticism abounds in Slim's relationships with other, especially more senior pimps. Slim rots in confinement for some time, and guess what, he doesn't enjoy it. This story is good antidote to the pervasive and unambiguous sexuality that gets portrayed on the rap videos (at least, it was when I last watched one in the mid 90's), which ignore the truly aberrent aspects to the lifestyle that gets shamelessly glorified."
Very Useful Info with Competitive Price,I packpacked to Argentina & Rio de Janiero with this guide book and it has everything that I need.
worth it,"Feed the Tree is by far the best belly single to be released...it's catchy, the lyrics draw you in, and well, yes, it's lite music, but fun too! check it out."
The Longest Day,"This has always been one of the movies I would want to have in my collection. It takes a dedicated viewer to watch and follow the entire film, but it's worth it when you get through it. The film attempts to show the issues for both sides of the conflict, the logistical problems, and the inner circle of command decisions that weighed heavily on the outcome of this hugely significant offensive.The producers do a nice job of creating sub-plots and weaving them into the film at large, even if they are not totally factual.It is good entertainment."
Not worth the money... and it's only $6,"I've really tried to use this timer for the past 6 months but sometimes it doesn't ring, other times it rings early, sometimes it just stops ticking. I've officially burned too much food and tossed it in the garbage. Ugh."
Loved it for years,"This movie is great. I have loved it since I was a kid. Most movies that you watch when you are a kid, aren't as good when you watch them in the later years. But this one is great. I was bopping away the whole time. It took me back to when I was watching whenever I was a kid. I loved it then and I still love it now."
Somewhat disappointed,"I am just a beginner in NT Greek, but I do know the alphabet, and have been disappointed when using this resource in conjunction with Thayer's Greek-English Lexicon, because the Greek spelling of the words (in some cases) don't match between the two. Maybe this is due to a fact that I'm ignorant of; if so, then I apologize - yet it still is confusing. Additionally, it is not coded to Strong's numbers (which is very handy if the spelling is not identical between two works)."
best folk implosion yet,I bought this record when it first came out in the early 90's and I loved all 25 minutes of it. I can't tell you how many times I have jigged to Sputnik's Down and wiggled to Slap Me. Would love to hear more of this from Mr. Barlow and Mr. Davis.
Beware: This CD is not mixed,"Just got the CD and was surprised to find that it's not evenmixed. I assumed it was a mixed compilation because of the accoladefrom Muzik magazine and the title ""Incredible Sound of..."" It should be titled ""The Incredible Songs that Trevor Nelson likes."" Shame on him for not having the talent to make a mix CD. Now I'm stuck with a [CD] full of single tracks and I'm not going to bust that out at a party."
It's ok,Nothing to rant and rave about. I like Dr. Koops medical books better. I don't think this one was worth the money.
blues clues - 1st christmas,"my 2 year old grandson loves blue's clues with steve,,,,this one was just okay for him....he likes the narriation of the adult steve"
"very tiny, not as nice as presented by the photo",The charm is very flat and not as nice as presented in the photo on amazon.
It's everything you expect,"If you EXPECT that cd repair kits don't work, and are a waste of money, you won't be disappointed."
Size Description Misleading,"The size small 4-6 has the wrong recommended age in the description. The Amazon description says 6-8 year olds, but when the costume actually arrived, the packaging indicated it was for 3-4 year olds. This is completely confusing as the sizing says 4-6. It was way too small for my 5 year old son, who is average height and on the slim side.For almost $30, the fabric is very flimsy and the belt looks nothing like the photo."
"""You must love dogs!""","And I do. The cast was terrific, it was a chick flick but many guys like this one too, Diane Lane was awesome and Cusack was believable in the role. I thought that the dialogue was ""on the money"" most of the time; but there were parts where it was stretching a bit. Because of the actors, the cute script and I guess because I just love dogs, I watched the movie a couple of times; first, on a plane and then I confess...I purchased the move and watched it again. With so many movies with ""serious messages"" that make you feel depressed at the end; it is just refreshing to watch a mindless comedy which just makes you feel good. Now what is wrong with that?Bentley/2007"
Original was Great but ......,"The original movie (Black & White) was great but this is a prime example of why ""colorization"" should be made illegal. The DVD quality is poor at best and the colorization (both DVD & VHS) is so poor that your attention is distracted from the wonderful story line & fine acting. We the buying/viewing public should demand a quality black & white version !"
Javier-Great Debut,This cd is totally worth the buy. It has all the songs that would make you want to find someone just to sing them too. And plus he is a mad cutie.
"Hood was alread included with the lens, so I got a spare hood (for what is worth)","I bought this hood the same time I bought ""Sony 50mm f/1.4 Lens for Sony Alpha Digital SLR Camera"" through Amazon. However, the description of the lens didn't include the information that the hood was included in the package.Hence, I've got myself a spare hood, which is as useless as ice cube to a eskimo."
"You can count on taxes, prices going up and Don Henley","Well..... at last. If you're an avid Henley fan you've now exhaled. The minute I heard Takin You Home I said that's and instant hit-time will prove me right. This is one of America's greatest poets and wordsmith of grand quality. I might remind everyone he's outlasted the Beatles etc. He sings his truths and he's put his beliefs on the line - hopefully we will all take time to think about what he has to say. We are certainly doing something like that 'cause there isn't a ticket left for his tour this summer. Darn! Yes I was a little disappointed not every song is his best yet, but he still has it-there is no doubt in my mind. He has other priorities now, if you listen to his words... If I was an American I'd hold this man in great esteem."
Battlefield 2 Logitech Headset,"Since I did not receive the game, this is not a review of the game but rather an observation of AMAZON's Process.I too am a Victim of receiving a headset with no game. The odd thing is that I don't remember any warnings when I ordered the game that stated I needed to order both the headset and the game. One would think that function would be automated. Especially since I got the headset today!!! I could understand if I got the headset weeks ago, but since they go together wouldn't you think they would be shipped together? This is truly an asinine way to run a business. Granted I have never had problems so far, but there isn't even any good recourse to ensure that I will get the game other than writing an e-mail and waiting for a response. AMAZON.....In the future, you should tie dependant items together so that when you order one you get the other as well automatically. You will have a much more satisfied customer in the end.Thanks for Nothing.....Literally"
Works like a charm.,"Have tried many of the starters out there,this one has not failed me.Wet,dry,or anything it will start a fire. Easy to pack and use."
ok but not well thought out,"There is a reason why all others have a loop for the other handle -- when the shears get stuck, you need to force them open, which is a real pain with these shears. I recommend some other brand."
Don't Buy This! Some Tubes are Defective!,"I didn't notice until after I had opened the package that 2 of the 6 tubes can't be opened- the companies didn't separate the plastic lid from the rest of the cap! So basically those tubes were useless, and I couldn't return them. Buy your Aquaphor somewhere else."
poor book for such a great horse,"What a poorly written book about such a fantastic horse. It is loaded with other obscure facts unrelated to the horse, trainer or story line. As a reader, we are forced to endure ""side trips"" as directed by the author which have nothing to do with the horse.Remember this horse was a spectacular race horse, but it is difficult to tell with this book! I would not recommend this book to anyone, except to the authors to revise this.Sad, such a poor tribute to such a great horse."
not so great,"there are better ""ball"" toys out there. my kids have loved ""pound a ball"" and the tomy ball mazes."
The original movie is better,"The original movie Ashes of Time was a masterpiece and gets 5 stars. Every shot of the film was like a painting, every line of dialogue was poetry.The only thing I like about the redux is the sharper images. The new music is not half as effective as the old music. The added titles severed the film into sections and disrupted the flow of the film. The new editing destroyed Leslie Cheung's narrative and rhythm of the film. I hate the bright yellow tint in desert scenes and green tint in some other scenes that make them look annoyingly unnatural. Brigitte Lin's dialogue was changed from the original Cantonese to Mandarin and sounds stiff, but is tolerable. I wish they had just cleaned up the image quality and kept everything else intact."
Les Miserables without the music !,"If you want to watch the story ""Les Miserables"" without the music, the 1952 version of the two films offered in this DVD is very good. It is a serious telling of the story and Michael Rennie carries the role expertly - giving us introspection and quietly leading us to examine systems that seem to be in place - usually for some set of reasons involving the exploitation of people - He portrays the death of the human spirit, until rescued when he rescues a woman - He then begins to come back to life, but will always be changed from his imprisonment and brutal treatment. This is a heavy and serious film and a good one to share with someone - inviting discussion afterward."
Read Something Else,"The greatest accomplishment of Christopher Paolini is that he and his family managed to get this thing published and that it found an audience. The writing is terrible, just terrible. I can't comment on the entertainment value this book may hold for some. After about eight chapters of some of the most juvenile prose in print I had to put this aside. There's lots of good, even great fantasy out there awaiting eager readers. They'd do well to skip over Eragon and seek out its betters."
"smaller than expected, not everything cuts","We can't complain other than they were smaller than we were expecting. I have a mini set from the same company, and its larger, and has alot of neat details. This kit has some things like the banana and the mushroom that don't cut open. Needless to say my almost 2 year old had no complaints with the toy, and played for most of the afternoon."
Stories with Heart,"These stories about the small-town life of rural New England more than lived up to the enticing professional reviews on the book cover. Each story grabbed me from the first sentence and never let go. For example, one story starts with: ""Two Jehovah's Witnesses, suffering in hot clothes, found the bodies a little before the cloudburst."""
missing geodes,this kit was ok except that there was no way even my 13 year old was going to break one...it took an adult with a hammer...and that it was short by 4!!!That is allot when you do not include many...out of the ones we had one was a good geode...go elsewhere!
Problems with this MP3 player from the first day.,"I had power issue with this player from the first time I tried to use it. At first the player would only start intermittently (even with a new battery installed). Eventually (after on a week of owning the player), it would not start at all. Rio technical support has been difficult to obtain and the do not offer a toll free support number. If you have problems, you will incur a toll call fee while you wait for assistance. Bad experiences all around. I have since owned both an IRock 128MB player and an IRiver 512MB player and have had much more success."
"Excellent, a Must-have for any writer","Get this, it is worth every penny. I have over half a dozen books on improving writing style, and this is one of the two best. I am a college professor, and this book is helping me write in a concise, and readable manner. It has great examples and insight from a true expert.There is one finicky chapter on word usage which is a waste of time, but the rest of the book is invaluable."
"Coach, Season II",Hayden Fox - what a goof...don't you just love him???? Love purchasing from Amazon...all was good.
boobahs stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"boobahs are a wasted piece of plastic.you should not buy this pathetic toy!!!!!it is loud,annoying and dumb.no affence or anything,but if you buy this toy you have lost your mind!!!spend your money on something important,not this pink piece of junk.boobahs are ugly too.it will give your children nightmares! please please PLEASE dont buy this pink junk!!!!!!!"
a very commercial reunion album 1985,"DP mark II line up is the best one of hard rock in history, this album is becoming a DP commercial symbol in the eighties,...though the songs aren't bad. I prefer the house of the blue light album 1986."
A BIT SMALL,"Even though the dimensions are listed in the description these seem small and we can not use the hood at all, it will not go over our toddlers average sized head, I doubt it would fit most babes over 6 months old. We gave it 3 stars because 1. we can still use the body of the towel, 2. it is fairly thick (not like a thirsty adult towel) compared to hooded towels found at the ""Super Stores"" and 3. it is still putting organic next to skin."
umm... not so sure about this one,"To be honest, I used probably less than half this book. I read through the verbal sections and those were ok. I skipped much of the math tutorials because I use math all the time in school. But when I got to scale reading, 3 out of 10 of the samples questions had incorrect answers. That was a shocker to me. How do book editors let 3 errors go unnoticed. Following that, in the mechanical section, there's a statement about how you compare viscosities of liquids.""engine oil has a high viscosity because it flows easily while molasses has a low viscosity because it flows quite slowly.""For those of us who've had a decent amount of exposure to either math, science, or mechanics, we would know this is a complete fallacy. The typist probably got ""high"" and ""low"" mixed up late at night while drinking liters of coffee. But this does a huge disservice to anyone who isn't too familiar with these things.I give this book 2 stars based on the absurdity of the errors."
Not worth it,"I recommend buying a camera bag instead. When I removed the case and started to take picture, I found it cumbersome as I have to hold on to the case. Save the money for the bag."
Brand new and great price,These are brand new brushheads and they were cheap so I gave them 5 stars. I dont care where they came from.
FYI - Spode is not the same Spode you've known in past...,"Now seeing several posts from buyers unsatisfied with recent purchases of Spode china (particularly the Christmas Tree pattern). Be aware that Spode was purchased by Portmeirion and has now off-shored this pattern to Malaysian and Chinese manufacturers. That said, you can continue your collection but the quality will not be the same. :(Portmeirion also purchased Royal Worcester..."
Take Me With You On The Road,"The Jayhawks were one of the bands who got the whole alt country thing on the road, and that really is what they're good at.Hollywood Town Hall is a perfect driving album. The songs are all short and punchy pop rock numbers with just the right amount of countrification.""Take Me With You When You Go"" and ""Waiting for the Sun"" are both classic tunes with the very slightest inclination of despair. In fact, all of the songs on this album are relatively easy listening but certainly stand up to repeat listens.The Jayhawks provide a clear illustration of how simple songs can have lasting value."
broken,"Got this toy a few months early as a christmas present, but by the time the present was given and taken out of the package, found out it didnt actually work, and by then it was too late to return it. Would have been cute if it had actually worked."
MUCH better for overnight than Huggies!,My kid used to always need a change of diaper half way through the night when we used Huggies Overnight pull-ups. This diaper holds more liquid and lasts overnight! I would recommend most Pampers products over Huggies or most other diaper brands!
Pius the 12th silent?,"This book claims that Pope Pius the 12th and the Catholic Church, for the most part were silent during the Holocaust. In a way that is true. The Pope learned early in the war that to speak out against the Nazis only brought about more severe retributions. Even leading Jewish clerics warned him not to do so. Instead he acted behind the scenes to save the lives of Jews, Gypsies, and others. He ordered Vatican buildings,convents and monasteries to hide and protect these hunted human beings from being slaughtered to the best of his ability. He ordered false baptismal and Communion documents to be printed up and given to these oppressed people. He even provided money and gold of his own to purchase freedom for some. Lets remember that the Vatican itself was an occupied country during the war. The fact that the Pope and the Catholic Church saved as many as 800,000 Jews during the war speaks volumns in itself.Would that the rest of the world had been as silent."
Mild road-movie,"A Hollywood film co-produced by several countries, where the director of ""Central Station"" can show parts of South America for First World consumption. The question is: how you would have filmed it? (If not as a tourist travelogue). The thing is that makes Ernesto Guevara a bones and flesh man (or boy), but could had used a little bit of film magic to foreshadow without bold statements the great man that Ernesto is on the brink to become. Maybe too episodic for his own good, but all road movies have that structure. Better if you speak Spanish, and great if you are Argentinean (to feel again that is the best country of Latin America)."
A great sleep bra,"I wear a size 40DD nursing bra, and I purchased this bra in size XL. It really is very comfortable: it doesn't bind, the fabric breathes and the shoulder straps don't cut into my shoulders. However, the stretchiness of the fabric makes this a rather loose-fitting bra; I probably could have gone with the large size instead of extra-large. I would certainly never wear this bra while exercising! I've found it's best as a sleeper bra. It holds nursing pads in very well, even when lying down and rolling over repeatedly, and it's the most comfortable bra I own to sleep in. Buy something with more support for during the day, but use this one at night."
Excellent resource!,Bought as an Xmas gift for someone involved in the restoration of 19th century (and older) homes in SE Pennsylvania. Well received.
A good Hack and Slash,"This game for all it's fun, is rather confining. You aren't given the opportunity to rove at will. I really like to be able to go anywhere I want to. In this game you have to go in one direction, fighting a plethora of creatures.The world itself is beautifully done, and the creatures you fight are some of the best around. There was basically no story, you just fight. For those who love a good Hack and Slash, you'll love this game. I found it exciting at first, but then that's all you do. No real puzzles to solve, no mysteries. Oh sure, you have the odd 'quest' now and then, but nothing that really challenges you.I gave this a four star rating because despite the linearness of it, I really enjoyed it."
This movie will steal your heart away.,"Beautiful scenery - the epitomy of dedication - Lindsey Wagoner is outstanding as a young doctor who goes back to the ""hills"" to bring modern medicine to the ""hill"" people who ""don't take to outsiders."" Jane Wyman as the ""Granny doctor"" is wonderful. James Wood as the ""sin-eater"" is spell-binding. This movie gives a wonderful glimpse of life in the ""back woods."" Heart-wrenching at times. A true classic. Get your ""hankie."" If you watch it, it will steal your heart away. It's one you won't forget......."
Visually Stunning,"While the Architect's process is touched upon, the real stars here are the photos of the models and buildings. This book offers the reader a fine sampling of the public buildings by an architect with a strong personal style. Interior and exterior shots (showing context nicely) abound, and the model work is just stunning. Sure to fire the imagination of the architecture enthusiast."
Does not work with yamaha,"After trying to get this to work for hours, I discovered that this was just sending random messages to my computer. Later I read that this does not work with yamaha keyboards. Very disappointed."
Bound for Mediocrity,"While the casting and acting are great I had serious problems with the music and story. The music is out of sequence, giving you a false impression of when the songs were written. And the story is just plain inaccurate, mixing time and place. So if you know anything about Woody Guthrie's life you will be sorely disappointed. On the other hand, if you just want a sense of who he was, at least up until about 1940, go for it!"
you'll be singing the songs for days,this is my favorite of all the barbie movies. my girls (and I) sing the songs all day long. the cd included was a surprizing bonus.
Son Loved Using it But Difficult to Clean,"Our son is a Cars fan, so he liked using this little soft seat, but the cushion doesn't come off and I could not get the front splash guard to come off for cleaning either. I tried to disinfect it in the bath tub, but after a year of use, I wound up throwing it away. I just could not get it clean enough."
From Abingdon Press,"Accepting the widespread view that 1 Thessalonians is the earliest surviving Pauline letter, the author commends reading it as fully as possible on its own terms, without presupposing or imposing themes or positions that are explicit only in letters of a later date. While he agrees with commentators who note this letter's pastoral aims and character, he is more convinced than some that it also exhibits a rich and coherent theological point of view. He interprets 2 Thessalonians as the work of an anonymous Paulinist writing several decades after the apostle's death. He regards this letter, too, as historically and theologically valuable, although less for what it discloses about Paul's ministry and thought than for what it shows about the reception and interpretation of Paul in the late first-century church."
Good not earthshaking,"While this book was good it was not earthshatteringly excellent. It some food for though, but nothing really new...mostly affirmations of what I already thought/felt/believed. A very quick read...I prefer things with more meat."
Not a good option for an active or female cat,"This box has many benefits, but the drawbacks outweigh them by far with my frisky 8-month-old little girl.The amount of litter that is tracked out is minimal, and the dome and filter work well for reducing odors. This litter box definitely delivers on both of these issues.However, my little kitty has successfully knocked off the lid numerous times. There is no way to latch the lid to the bottom, and unfortunately the lid shifts often. If you combine the shaky lid with a female cat, you get urine leaking through the crack and on the floor. Not pleasant or desired. Despite the unique and useful design of this product, I would not recommend it."
Bankers Box,"all Bankers Boxes are great. I am using these to store files like old taxes, etc. They fit many shelving units and are very useful."
A Disappointing Evening,"I had expected commentary on the background of the songs as was in the wonderful""An Evening with Dorothy Fields"". This was straight singing with an unappealing choice of songs, especially the ones from ""Most Happy Fella"". A waste of time and money."
Groucho made boring,"This book, while no doubt being historically accurate, manges to turn the life of one of our most colorful personalities into a complete bore. It is nothing more than an encylopedic listing of one fact after another. Somehow he has managed to include almost all of the unfunny interviews with contestants in the book and omit the great ones. Anybody who reads this book and had never seen the show would surely wonder why we all enjoyed it so muh"
A nice idea but,I have to say my only knock against the game is a single story line instead of the player vs player element. Especially for $60 is a bit much.
"Boring, indeed","There's a quick full frontal of the teen girl, but that's about as erotic as this 1988 French film gets. It's a coming of age tale, but we never really care about any of the characters because the script is so solemn and dull. Drones on for almost 2 hours, as well. Not great."
"Well, the pets LOVE it...","This product was prescribed by my collie's vet, because of all four of my middle aged, animals (dogs and cats), she has terrible teeth, and the breath that goes with it. I don't know if it will help with her ongoing problem with tartar build-up, but it definitely helps her breath. And all of the animals seem to love the water with the product added. (If you smell it, it smells just like a particularly yucky kind of candy!) So at least everyone is getting plenty of water."
Disappointing,"I had to give this book a bad review because it was a horrible ending to a trilogy that showed promise. Although book 2 should have been edited and made part of this book. Ok let me gripe about this book. It takes forever to reach the the main battle between the hero and the villian but the fight is over in like 5 seconds. Iakhovas worked all kinds of impressive magics, slayed huge creatures, and completed all kinds of other mystical feats to basically be stabbed once or twice and bam it's over. Horrible ending. Also no closure either. After this climatic battle if one would call it theres a whole 2 pages maybe. Plus I have to gripe about Jhereks mystical weapons. They are stupid. Plain and simple."
MURDEROUS PIXEL,"OBSERVATIONS ON THIS MOVIE:*It's way too long and can't sustain suspense or interest for such a length.*A preposterous plot that never comes near to being credible.*Peter Gallagher's character is entirely unlikeable; he does one stupid thing after another and is unfair to both his wife, Mimi Rogers, and the siren Juliet Spring (Bridgette Nelson Sampras).*Why would anyone not see how manipulative and selfish Nelson's character is?*The scene where Mimi Rogers throws the head is either intentionally or unintentionally hilarious.Director Mick Garris usually does better work (he's done many of the Stephen King tv adaptations) than this.Worth a rental if you have two and a half hours you can't possibly find anything better to do with."
So UNCOMFORTABLE for the baby. BULKY and HARD to use.,"My daughter is 40 days old. As soon as I laid her in the sling and had the sling in carrying position I could see that she was very uncomfortable.Contour of your stomach is not FLAT but CURVED. It tilts my daughter's spine SIDEWAYS when she is lying flat in the sling. It's just not a comfortable position for the baby.The video teaches you how to carry the baby in different ways. However, they are useless if the baby is an infant and can't support her neck on her own.Besided, it is BULKY and HARD to use. I am returning it."
Dont waste your time,"I am not sure why or how this got published - it is boring and sappy. I dont think I will ever buy a patterson again. The number of times this book has the words ""lucky"", ""happy"", ""love"" is unbelievable. I would rate this a zero if I could."
My daughter loves this pendant,"My daughter wears this pendant on a box chain necklace all the time, and she absolutely loves it. Great quality, especially for the price."
a corny series,"Although I have just watched the first two of the seriers, (as well as the first, not part of this series). I felt that the movies had it's moments of jumpyness, but I still felt that they were corny.I did enjoy them, but I felt it was hilarious when the corn started to kill people. I also felt that how people died was completley unrealisitic. I mean I didn't expect it to be completely realistic obviously. But it was so unrealistic, it was almost humourus. And as well as the monster in the end. I was like, ""that's it"" I felt it looked like a really angry big booger. I laughed.Not a fav series, at all. But so corny, it's intertaining. Fun to watch every once in a while. But not on my watch regular list"
"A fair, fun game for kids","This is a game I played growing up and I liked it a lot, I mean, what kid DOESN'T want to ride an electronic dinosaur!? Fairly fun, and a good gift for the kids."
This book is wonderful. Easy to read and follow,"If you need a guideline to explore your dreams, discover what you want and how to do it than this is the book! Its laid out in a readable easy to follow fashion and great for anyone who could use a little help making your desires possible."
A great series,"This book, as well as the others in the ""Andrew Lost"" series, is wonderful! I stumbled across it as a gift for my nephew, but decided to read it to my 6 & 8 year old sons. They loved it, and we have read the whole series. Andrew's adventures kept the boys interested and there was a whole lot of learning too. Because Andrew is shrunk to a level we don't normally see, we get an ""up close"" look at things thru his adventures. There is lots of science, like what the color of a bubble means and how an insect sees with its many eyes (and so much more!). The books are sufficiently ""gross"" to interest boys, but not so gross that I couldn't read them. In fact, I learned at least as much as they did. Really interesting stuff! The chapters are short and easy to read. We finished each book in 2-3 sittings. I highly recommend these books."
this is a bad movie,"Johnny Depp plays Frank Abberline as a greasy drug addict. Heather Graham plays Mary Kelly as a beautiful, healthy and charming street hooker. This alone should tell you that the Hughes brothers aren't even trying to make a remotely accurate film. The ending is partially a rip off of of the superior Michael Caine movie and partially an idiot's fantasy. I'd have to say this is the worst Ripper film I've ever seen."
"Very nice, but do cut down on the slack...","The final release from Texas before their Greatest Hits compilation sees them in a confident mood. Their pop-rock sensibilities have been refined, and we get such effortlessly catchy yet substantial tracks like ""In Our Lifetime"" with its Oriental-esque beat, the vaguely cool raunchiness of ""Summer Son"", the adorably laidback ""Sunday Afternoon"", and the ebullient ""When We Are Together,"" their best neo-Motown composition since ""Black Eyed Boy"" (""White on Blonde"", 1997). Unfortunately the rest of it appears mired closer to MoR territory compared to their 1997 record, with either sweet nothingness (""Girl"", ""Day After Day"") or could've-been-betters (""Saint"" begins like the most accomplished Texas song ever, only to be nearly killed by the ensuing repetitiveness). Recommended mainly if one has appreciation of their previous release ""White on Blonde"" (1997). Overall Rating: a strong 3/5."
Great for Research Papers,"I found this book incredibly useful for a recent research paper I had to complete on Shakespeare's Othello. It details the themes, imagery, and characters of Shakespeare's greatest tragedy, Othello. You may also want to check out A.C. Bradley's Shakespearean Tragedy and Bloom's Iago, both wonderful literary criticisms with some focus on Othello."
AnAwesome Bear for the hospital bed!!,Perfect gift for someone in the Hospital!!! Will order more of these Bears!! Keeps you from having to transport plants from the Hospital...
Not my favorite,"This is the second Sesame Beginnings video we have purchased. We have Moving Together which I absolutely love. I don't like the dynamics of the host, Brandy and her daughter in this one and I don't think the songs are as good although they get stuck in my head quite a bit! Not our favorite. I would like to try some of the other ones."
Liver cleanse diet,"I found this a very good source for learning how to do the cleansing diet. Only thing missing was a shopping list, although she did provide recipes to follow, I preferred to come up with my own. I did use some of the recipes for ideas. I wish she had given some recipes for the juices. Other than that, a very informative reference on how to and why to do a liver cleanse."
No CC or HOH,"A Pity that the producers have not added closed caption for the Hard of Hearing! PITY PITYNO Sale here and probably none for another 100 MILLION hard of hearing people.Ata go - come back to this when your hearing deteriorates, Mr. Movie Man."
wouldn't buy again,"I received this bell about 9 months ago. I bike every day to work and thus I've used the bell quite a bit and am very familiar with it. I like the timbre of the bell and the loudness -- this was great. However, after 9 months, through rain and muck, the ringer mechanism has already rusted and broken. So it's no longer a bell. The compass is one of the crappiest compasses I've ever had (and hardly useful). So I love the idea of a dual purpose bell, but I think this one fails in both regards."
Pervasive disgusting language,"Ruins the movie.Otherwise would have been a decent film but the constant usage of ""J**** Ch***"" and ""G** D***"" has completely ruined the movie. What a terrible film.ZERO stars."
No good unless you're a Kennedy worshipper AND superstitious,"What can I say about a sentence like this: ""The sons of these (Irish) immigrants (such as the Kennedys) were often treated worse than Negro slaves.""Geez, with such historically uninformed, Kleenix-inducing blather like that (with which professional historians AND the descendants of those slaves would disagree), what else can you say about the suck-up level of this book?There are a few historical nuggets to be found if you can get past BOTH the hagiography AND the superstitiousness of the author believing in a literal Kennedy family curse.But, it's really not worth that much effort, probably.Also, the Bushes, and with far more justification, the Adamses, might object to the Kennedys being labeled America's greatest political dynasty."
Hmm..,This book is alright. It has a close connection to teenaged girls and what goes on with them. This reminds me a lot of the book 'That Summer' by Sarah Dessen.
Drizzt vs Liriel,"There are two distinct visions of what Menzoberanzan really is. One, is that of Drizzt, the Salvatore character. The other is Liriel, the Cunningham character. I have read all the books by both authors, and they are all well written. The primary difference is that each character undergoes differing sets of circumstances. Drizzt is a noble male raised in a violent matriarchal society. Liriel is a noble female in the same society. Liriel, through her series of books, has to learn the lessons of honor and loyalty, not mention responsibility and proper behavior because it was never taught to her. Liriel's story is the the female perspective of drow culture. Drizzt's is the male. As a reader of both, I found Salvatore did not really emphasize female perspective. To truly understand the drow cities, be it Menzoberanzan of Ched Nasad, both authors are a must read."
reprints with different names,"I do love these authors and was so glad to find a new book. But. . . it is a collection of two books I already have put into one volume with a new name. Not quite the nice reading time I was looking forward to. I won't be the only one to buy it without knowing this so look for used ""like new"" to be available quickly. This is The Ship Who Searched and Partnership simply put in one volume. If you want these two books it is a good deal - if not . . ."
Good but not awesome,Somewhat disappointing compared to the Talon Mix. Covering the last few seasons of Smallville we get a few good songs like Precious by Depeche Mode and Forget It by Breaking Benjamin. There's about 4 or 5 good songs here so I guess it's worth picking up.
amazing,arrived on time. this was just as decribbed. actually better. it was wrapped. i recomend this to people of anime otaku status
Don't read The Red Tent until you read this,"I enjoyed the time period in which this novel was set. However, I would have preferred it to be completely fictional and not based upon real people. Why? For the simple reason that there are several obvious contradictions to the biblical account of Dinah and her family. I would encourage any who wish to read this book to first read the following passages from the bible: Genesis 25:19-34, 27:1-28:9, 29:1-35:26, 37:1-36, 39:1-50:26. Not all of these are directly tied to the novel, but they give background and family history. Pay close attention to 29:22-30, 31:34&35, and 39:10&12. Even if you know the stories of Jacob and Joseph, it won't hurt to refresh your memory."
Poor quality with cut and paste velcro. As you can see there is no velcro on this picture--at all.,Item not like shown. Misleading. Should have had more of an accurate description so I would not have wasted my money.
Not worth the time -,"This book is New Age fluff - not worth the time it took to read it. Has no practical or innovative approach to offer. Author indicates you need to deal with all your life issues before you can lose weight. If that's the case, no one will ever lose weight. Better off spending your time reading ""Overcoming Overeating"" - a gem of a book written in 1988 - find it on Amazon for less than ( ). Absolutely novel concept - it's working for me. Approach with an open mind and commitment. OA veterans will find ""Overcoming Overeating"" scarey - it preaches liberation, not a lifetime of reinforcing ""I'm a compulsive overeater."" It's a cure - not an excuse or a prison. Try it."
Not up to expectations,I bought the vanilla bean extract but I was very disappointed to find that it has a stronger alcoholic flavour to it than the actual vanilla flavour. The extract was also not as thick as the other extracts I have used. I have not tried the vanilla bean paste of this brand and maybe that is of a better quality than the extract.
execellent!!!!!,I love this CD because I love Frankie Beverly and Maze. I have listen to this CD over and over again. I recommend this to everyone.
The ultimate in electric tea kettles,"I was given one of these Braun electric water kettles as a gift at Christmas and just love it. Everytime I use it with company, they all say they want one also. It is pleasing to the eye as well as very fast heating. My daughter who is a mother of 2 boys asked for it for her birthday. I ordered this one from Amazon as I could not find them in the local stores. She is very happy with it. I am thinking of who I might get one as a gift this year."
You might need to butter your popcorn,"...with LSD in order to enjoy this movie. As many have said, the idea is interesting. Psychotic telepaths revolt against a defense contractor studying them for use as a war weapon. The story told is nonsensical, fantastic, and confusing, though. The acting is beyond the pale. The explodyhead scene is about as cool as this movie gets, I'm afraid. It's somewhat fun to watch Patrick Mcgoohan and Michael Ironside mug their way through the terrible script, I guess. The audio effects of the people talking in the scanners' heads might tempt the chemically impaired to think this movie is awwwwesome as well.Maybe if I viewed this as something of an abstraction I could have suspended my disbelief with some of the logical chasms in the film, but as a linear, plot-driven movie this was El Bombola. Cronenberg is a daring director, always willing to explore the strange and perverse, but I'd call Scanners fairly overrated for those who would rate it highly at all."
Moluscum No More has changed our life,"My 7 year old son is recovering from Molluscum. Several visits to the Pediatrition and we were always given the, ""give it time, the body must figure out the virus is there""-- ( blah blah blah) We were given some retin-a samples that helped a little but barely. I searched and searched this summer while my little man had over a hundred molluscum bumps all over his face, chin, torso, arms and knees. It was truly horrible. He did not want to swim or play with freinds. The bumps were every where. After a lot of research, I finally decided to try Molluscum No More and it really worked for us. With in three glorious weeks, he is almost heeled. This product was an answer to our prayers and we are so happy to have found it! Try it, IT REALLY WORKS!"
not bad,"The baby loved thses toys when they worked, 2 out of the 3 malfunctions within the first day. The third one has very little volume left to it."
"Oh no, no more Alice in Wonderland remakes, please!","The earlier versions of Alice in Wonderland (eg. 1951 cartoon edition) was, well, good. Cheerful. Happy. This 1999 version is at the bottom of the ones I've seen. The only thing that grabs you a bit is Alice shrinking and growing and the walls all changing. But nothing else pretty much amuses me, in fact, everything else is complete dull waste-your-money blogs. Don't watch this version... at least don't buy it. Use this review and instead borrow or rent it. (Get the earlier ones)"
Wonders of the Vatican Library: The Rosary,Very good informative voice over and pictures of the rosary. A wonderful DVD for parents to watch with their children and to discuss the life of Christ and the prayers of the Rosary.
poor quality,As soon as I opened the case it just fell apart. Now I have a bunch of great DVD'S just laying around without a case. At least they play good.
Asynchronous Circuit Theory?,"I'm actually pretty disappointed in the book. I was hoping for asynchronous circuits. A better title for the book would be ""Asynchronous Circuit Theory"". The book is more of an Ivory Tower book that describes theory, with not as much practical information as would be hoped. The VHDL examples in the back are so completely removed from what could ever be synthesized, that they're useless from an HDL standpoint. It would even be helpful if he gave us an idea of what simulator could actually simulate his VHDL, because none of mine could. And without any comments or descriptions of the code, I couldn't even figure out what he was trying to do to make it work.However. If you want to be caught up in the latest asynchronous theory, this book is excellent. It uses a very simple ""wine shop"" paradigm throughout the book to help the reader understand each new principle."
Look elsware,"I am horrible dissapointed with the progression of the studio line. I was a huge fan of the studio product in the past, but now i will look elswhere. I have a brand new top of the line computer and this program still can lock up or crah after rendering for 12 plus hours, this is untolerable and unnacceptable. Hopefully studio nine will be tenfold better or definatly look for another company."
Consumers be warned!!,"I've used pyrex for years with no problem, but last week while baking a casserole (with no sudden temperature changes or other misuse) my pyrex dish shattered into a million glass shards. A friend of mine had told me about a similar experience, but I had assumed that hers must have been a different brand. It turns out this has happened to LOTS of other people with pyrex - check out [...]. Statistically, your chances of it happening to you are probably low, but if it does happen the danger is very real. Sorry, but I'm getting rid of all my pyrex and recommending that others do likewise."
Freedom Suite: The Courageous Commentary,"The Rascals were always at the forefront of social issues. The fractious tone of American society in the late 60's had some people denying that America was on the brink of political and moral decay, but the courageous ones knew that things were going awfully wrong and The Rascals clearly reflected on and exposed the violence, bigotry, and intolerance of the nation at the time. Just listen to ""Look Around"" and you can get a clear picture of American society in flux. Freedom Suite is a great time capsule, a primary source delving into America at the crossroads in a time of uncertainty and confusion. A great album and statement."
Oh Aaron This Stinks!,"Aaron Carter's second album Oh Aaron Is bad. It is horrible having to listen to this boy trying to rap!I do think when I hear him sing instead of annoying the crap out of me by rapping, he sings great & he has a good singing voice & sounds like his brother! Instead Of wasting his time trying to rap he is better off singing otherwise I do not think he will get very far!However I did like 1 song when he sung like I'm All About us, & the rest of the album stunk!I recommend Nick Carter Now or Never instead of Oh Aaron!"
not worth the money,The unit does not have much power and the cord is too short. Not worth the money! Could have purchased a small unit with more power @ less cost. Would not buy again.
Not at all like Mary Shelley's novel.,"Do not be taken in by the statement on the cover - ""true to the original."" This is a poor action film with none of the sentiment of the book."
worst reliability experienced,Went through two of these routers in 14 months. Now out of warranty and out of luck. Don't buy this product if you want a reliable router!
Too long,"This was a pretty good book but not as good as her others. Main character, Jean, was a little stiff, Jake was annoying and Sam a little dense, but all of the suspects made the book interesting. Also, the book was tooooooo long, it should have been no more than 340 pages, too many details that were not necessary."
They Finally Found All The Parts,"""All Shook Up"" has always been one of Cheap Trick's most problematic albums, and the muddy mix of the original CD issue only made it that much more of a difficult listen. This remastering job goes a long way toward reclaiming some of the virtues of this recording, although it does bring the weaker material (""High Priest of Rythmnic Noise"")into somewhat unwelcome relief. No matter. It is still, overall, a decent album even if it is not on par with Cheap Trick's best. The real treat is the inclusion of the long lost ""Found All The Parts"" EP. It's nice to have these songs back after all these years. Well worth the price!"
Not that good or interesting...,"This was not worth the 7.99. the story is not interesting. The writer was pretty lazy here and I think needs a break after ""writing"" 38 books in the MSW series.Jessica is pretty wacky in this, she actually asks someone where they were at the time of ""death"" before the ""death"" is even rerealed; really poorly done. I guess i will finish reading this junk but wish I could trade it. Most of the MSW books are great, the best of course are set in Cabot Cove, but some are great out of it (Savannah etc.)I wouldn't waste my money on this, unless u find the paperback in a used bookstore for a buck or two."
One of the top reggae albums of all time,"A must for any roots reggae fan. 'Jah Pretty Face', 'Two Sevens Clash' and 'I'm Not Ashamed' are worth the price of the cd alone. Pick this one up!"
Nice story for children,"It is true to the Disney tradition. Princess has a delema, and needs to figure out how to solve it. Everything neatly wrapped up by 5 min. before the end of the movie. I recommend it for girls esp. ages 5-10"
AMBER STONE POWER IN SCIENCE FICTION,"This book gives a futuristic look into a parallel universe where antique hunting is a major revenue, causing the usual problems that inevitably occur when big money in involved. It's a universe where humans with well-developed psychic powers can summon ghosts for protection and destruction. In this universe, there are also other humans with intensive ghost-fighting powers. The story starts with the discovery of a dead body and no suspects. Then it continues until the killers and the reason are found. Amber stones worn by everyone and the color green play important roles also. Behind the mystery and the powers, there's a small love story brewing. AFTER DARK is a science fiction story where a highly vivid imagination is mandatory."
ONE OF THE BEST VOICES EVER,"NANA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SINGERS. SHE PUTS YOU IN TRANCE...THE MUSIC AND THE MESSAGE OF HER WORDS ARE BEYOND THIS WORLD...SHE IS FROMTHE REALM OF PEACE, JOY AND LOVE..."
1 of the best of 3,"This is one of the best double cd's out the 3 best. The other two being 2pac ""all eyes on me"" and Biggie ""life after death"". This cd can easily be compared to both of those. It has dope lyrics, beats, flow, right amount of guest, and both cd's are bangin.A lot of people slept on this because it did not get mainstream exposure, but it is truly a good album. Out of both disc i may skip two songs. The guest on this cd is amazing, people from all coast are on here. I promise if you even semi like 8Ball u will like this album. Hotep!!"
The basics are still the basics - even old and out of date,"This is NOT a get rich quick scheme. It is diligent consistent work. The basic principles are the same today as they were in 1985. The financial world has changed dramatically in the past couple of years, therefore owner financing is even more important today. If you do what they teach you, you will benefit and learn. The reason people don't succeed is because they aren't willing to put the work in that is necessary to do each step and make 100 calls for only 1 yes."
"Energetic, Spiritual","Although it doesn't have a lot of huge radio hits, 'October' is a very good U2 album. 'Gloria' may be the only song here that got considerable radio exposure, but several others should have.This is a very high energy collection with a spiritual theme running through it. The lyrics, vocals, and instrumental work all combine to make a very good effort.This is an album that was pretty much ignored in their first 'best of' collection, but there are some songs here that should have made the cut. I particularly like 'October' and 'Gloria'. Beyond those two, there are several others that will grow on you the more you listen to them. I recommend it."
This book helped me regain control of my life,"This is a great book on how to eat healthy, but Mr. Phillips also recognizes that we are human and not perfect. By following his recommendations on planning the day ahead of time I have completely changed my eating and work habits. I really do have more free time. I also can look forward to a 'free day' which keeps me on track. My wife and I have been following the plan for two weeks and have really enjoyed the recipes from the book. As a companion to his Body-For-Life book I am already noticing changes in my 43-year old physique."
NOT A PACK OF THREE,"This item states it is a ""pack of 3"". Much like another reviewer, I only received a single unit. My return shipment has been accepted. The value of this item is significantly diminished by this error, and I am much annoyed by the deception."
Awesome!,"I love Starship, and have since I was a little girl. My parents were big fans and I grew up listening to them. I love A LOT of their older stuff, but this is by far my favorite of all their albums, so when it snapped in two, I had to get on here and order another copy!"
aerator,"Great product, does the work but the screws kept falling off and need constant tightening otherwise you loose all of them in the grass"
Nice Ring,The ring was very nice. Good quality for a fair price. I liked the detailing on the side of the ring with the trinity on both sides of the ring. You'll like this product!
"So far, so good!","We have been using this for our 7 & 8 year old boys soccer team, and so far it is perfect! We have used it for about 10 games, and there have been no problems. It is great for the kids who aren't in the game at any given time. We haven't had any rainy weather yet, but think it will be nice for them to not have to sit on their soccer balls or on the wet ground. Not very heavy, and easy to set up and fold up after use."
Not mean. Or odd.,"Vowell travels the country, visiting places presidents have been assassinated. Along the way we see America's obsession with violence and hype, but, strangely, it doesn't feel mean or odd."
McGruder is ugly!,"That alone is reason enough not to buy this book. Ha! Ha! That's satire. Furthermore, no Asian calls himself ""oriental""! McGruder is a hypocrite and an idiot! And his comic book shows it. He wouldn't know what comedy is if it bit him in his skinny behind. The only thing funny about this book is McGruder's picture on the back. He just finished doing comics on ""embarassing black people of the year"" without putting himself in it."
Good solid Disc,"Ambrosia are a solid Band.I Grew up digging their music.Biggest Part Of Me is a Great song.also I dug Time Waits for no one,I Just Can't Let Go with James Ingram&Michael Mccdonald& of course How Much I Feel.alot of folks can Relate to that song.this is a Good solid disc."
Great music,I love this CD. The music is really great. However some of the stuff on it takes away from the sound. I think that they are really talanted but I don't think that they need to have so much stuff about sex in it. I mean half the CD is entirely about sex. I don't mind the language so much as his obsession on sex. I don't see why they need that on there. But like I said I absolutly love the music part and the way he raps. Every song is enjoyable to listen to and that is only because of the music. With the possible exception of a few songs. One or two are O.K. lyrically and musically. You'll never tire of listening to it over and over again; I know I dont.
Casino 6-Deck Automatic Card Shuffler,"I bought the shuffler hoping it would help shuffle 4-5 decks at a time. It mostly shuffled perfectly, but about 6 out of 10 times, the cards would jam in the receiving tray. The spring that makes it go down as the cards come out didn't seem very stable. Also, unless I placed my hand in front of the clear plastic guard, the cards wouldn't eject smoothly. If I had it to do over again, I would not have purchased. Even though it worked most of the time, it was cumbersome to use."
It's a no-buy,"For all you review-readers out there, save yourself the money and don't get this book. As stated by so many here before, it's a rip-off of, to name a few, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pern, Earthsea, etc. Paolini can't even make up his own language. If you look carefully at the words, they sound /strangely/ like synonyms of the word they're supposed to mean. Let me see, the word vonder for a thin, straight stick, can I say 'WAND'? Or how about thrysta for thrust... arget for silver? The word for silver in latin is argentium. GET ORIGIONAL, CP.And for those who say, ""oh, he wrote it at the age of 15!"" he didn't. He was 19.Another fact: Look at the majority of people who gave good reviews:A. They were CHILDREN. Under the age of 13.B. MOMS talking about their CHILDREN enjoying it.Again I say, save your money and buy a better book."
Bad wires,"The cords always seemed stiff. The wires broke inside the cords at the strain relief after six months. Almost any removal of the phones causes them to reset to the tightest fitting. Good sound, but generally poor design."
"""L'Age Blanc .......""","Slightly like yesterday's soup, this tribute to Luis Bunel ['L'Age d'or', 'Un Chien Andalou', etc.] creepily pulls the viewer along its rather 'high-school' conceived plot - everything has a formula, everything reduces to numbers ....Visuals are interesting but repeated - especially in the editing of the later ""Requiem for a Dream"" - although it's taunting to imagine what this director might have done to 'Solaris"" - [yes, there's also the obvious Kubrick kick - and quite a lot of Roman Polanski's ""The Tenant"" thrown in for good measure ...Well, back to the drawing board .... but leave the ants to Bunel...."
It Takes Two,"It's an excellent movie, but if you copy the language you hear on movies (and you're under the age of say, 20) maybe not. Amanda is an orphan heading off to Camp Callaway (coincidentally owned by Alyssa's father Roger) with her best friend and social worker Diane Barrows. Alyssa is a rich little girl who hardly sees her father at all, and he is getting married to an abnormally horrendous woman. When the girls bump smack into each other in the woods, they find that they are complete look-alikes. Together they scheme to bring Alyssa's father and Diane together before adoption and marriage break them up. A great movie, especially for fans of the Olsens. It's just a Parent Trap knock off."
A Huge Dissapointment,"I picked up this book happy to read that someone had the courage to tackle the issues of the working poor. Sadly, this book misses and misses dreadfully. Ms. Newman spent years of research and it comes across that she sat in her academic office and never had the guts to go into the neighberhoods she represents in her book. She blames the poor for most of their problems instead of the companies who pay wages that aren't livable. Why didn't she write a book about companies that feel it's ok to pay someone $5.00 and hour and expect them to survive in life. How can we as humans think this is acceptable behavior. If her so called Burger Barn cut some of it's profits and gave it to the workers, just think you'd have happy encouraged workers and billionaires who maybe can't buy a new plane that year."
No mice,"I bought two Victor brand Tin Cat, Clear Top, mouse traps. Placed them in different places in the home, mostly along the walls, where I know mice are running. I was using either no bait or different baits; crackers, cookies, raisons, candy, peanut butter, seeds. So far, no mice have entered these traps. Still finding mouse droppings, so I know they are around, but they are avoiding these traps. So far, I can say that this type and brand is not working for me."
Best Ozzy Compilation Ever,"This is by far my favorite Ozzy compilation album. It saved me loads of money because I would've bought a whole bunch of different albums jsut for my favorite songs, when they're already on this one. Amazing album."
so you don't want to go to church anymore,with simple words the author has been able to communicate the depth of his pilgrimage with the Lord. very interesting approach ... a book I would suggest for everybody to read.
Desparate For Updates,"Excellent book and wonderful photos. Not much of an introduction and is more like a catalog.Desparately needs to be updated, as the market for Black Collectibles is beginning to surge again."
Delightful fun,"Kirkus' review above is reasonably accurate in its description of the plot of this book, but is quite patronizing. Granted, it's not great literature, but I enjoyed it thoroughly.It reminds me of Joanna Trollope, Katie Fforde, and, a little, of Mary Wesley, though I don't think it quite as good as theirs. Can't always have the best, though, and this is definitely a good read.I wonder who Kirkus likes a lot?"
Died a quiet death,"I bought one of these to help me control the chaos of Firewire and USB wires on my desktop. I have had it about 4 months. It died. I am unable to return it to iogear since I no longer have the original packaging or receipt.My home office started to smell like burning electronics. The unit had overheated. Luckily it did not take anything that was plugged in to it with it. I think I will not be buying an off-brand again to save a few pennies.While it worked, it worked great (thus 2 stars vs 1)."
Great movie!!,"LOVE this movie. So wish I could buy it on DVD. Really funny w great music. ""Love is Love"" by Culture Club was on my Summer 2011 wedding CD!"
Excellent Read,Was talking with an elderly European friend about Hitler's rise to power. Our discussion led to my query about how everyday Germans responded to his 'leadership'. My friend recommended this book. Hegi provides a believeable account of life in Germany during the rise of Hitler. Her characters are knowable and thoroughly human. I finished the book having a better understanding of how this terrible time in history occurred.
to small,"the bag was ok. The material seemed a little low quality as compaired to the product description and the dims on the site and some of the reviews lead me to beleive that the bag would work for my laptop however when i received the bad the laptop in no way would safely fit. the return process with this company is annoying. you have to email them and once they decide you have a good enough reason to return the item (they dont let you explain you must choose from their completely unrelated reasons) which took a few emails for my reason to ""qualify"". you ship it back and are charged a ""restocking fee""."
Moulin Rouge the greatest movie of my time (so far),This is a review of Moulin Rouge. I think this is a great movie I especially liked the club and the sets. The story line is easy to follow and really captures the theatre. The songs are really amazing and the cast are just perfect. I enjoy all of the scenes and even enjoy the sad parts (I wont tell you what they are you have to watch it for yourself) at the moment i am searching for all of the CDs and posters i hope you anjoy the film as much aqs i didEmily
Collection of the Qu'ran,"John Burton attempts to outline the history of the collection of the Qu'ran. He starts by calling all the Muslim Sources of the history into question, this he does semi succesfully. He then goes on to reject the Mulism sources, leaving scholars with absolutely no sources with which to base the history. This leaves him a blank canvas where he can paint his own picture, without having to ever rely on evidence. His hypothesis, that Muhamed himself was the first collector of the Qu'ran, is just about the only one not found in any hadith collection. Needless to say, his argument for the early codification of the Qur'an fails miserably. In addition the book tends to rely heavily on technical language which makes it inaccessible to a beginning student of Islam."
Faberware 12-cup Percolator,I love this coffee pot it is much lighter than the one that broke on me after many many years of use. I would definitly but another!
A Horrifying story,"This book is very poorly written. I didnt enjoy the story at all. Reading this book, for me, was like reading the catcher in the rye. The author rattled and rambled through the whole story. I'm sure that it could have been a better book if she had someone to help her with the editing. I really can't say that I would reccomend this book to anyone. Read the back of the book and you have a good idea of what's in the book."
"sufficient, but take care","It had been several years since I'd sprouted grass at home, so I thought a kit would be an easy way to get back into the swing of things. I'm glad I went ahead with the purchase, but not because the product is really any good. The instructions on the card were different from the method I had used in the past (and strongly contradicted at several points by the contents of the book that came with the kit, which I thought was odd) but I gave them a try for my first tray... and lost that batch. Go ahead and ignore the instruction card.It was nice to start with everything arriving together; it helped commit me to the project, but for the long term the kit really isn't necessary."
Thomas Harris Move Over??? Whatever!!,"This wasn't the worst book I've read...I actually have mixed feelings...the killer was scary, twisted, etc. and some of the cops were very well developed as characters...but there was too much ""touchy/feely"" stuff in it for a serial killer book. That might sound lame but it's the only way I know how to put it...again, not the worst book...but the reviewers on the cover that said things to the effect of ""Thomas Harris move over...there's a new game in town.."" Whatever! There's no comparison between McFadyen and Harris...Harris is the master and McFadyen is...well...not the master!"
Same old pap,The value of an alkaline diet is not disputed but Mr. Young's methods and products are not the only way of achieving the desired results.I met this author at a book signing in Honolulu and he seemed more interested in selling books and wheat grass than being open minded about other supplements. A booked called the Tao of Detox seemed more informative to me.
Good book for first time travelers,"I thought this book might have some good insights and tactical tips into packing better, but I'm left disappointed that it is full of long lists, and seems written for the first-time traveler. I am now traveling heavily in a new job, but have found little useful info here."
A great product at a terrific price,I researched this product and read ALL of the reviews. I wasskeptical at first but decided to buy it anyway. At [the price] you can't go wrong. As a professional chef I have tried numerous mandolines and this is by far the best. If you know anything about Hoffritz you know they produce some of the best blades in the industry. If you cut yourself on this product (as many apparently have) then you're doing something foolish or you're not paying attention. As soon as I'm finished here I'm ordering three more - that's how much I like them.
One of the best books I've ever read.,"My brother(8) and I(12) have read all of the books in the series. Every summer, we go to Maine and become Titty and Roger. My mother is Susan, and my father is John. We even have our own Swallow. Our cat also has a job--Sinbad. In Maine, we live on Moosehead Lake, and so we are able to relive a different book each summer."
La Renga: una representacion,"La renga se destaca por saber mezclar las realidades del pais, un buen acompañamiento musical, la pasion futbolera, su fuerza, la identificacion de los jovenes. Las letras dicen mucho, y el que diga lo contrario es porque no las escucho o no las razono. La exelente calidad de CHIZO como guitarrista, la sobresaliente actuacion de los instrumentos de viento (armonica, saxo) y el muy buen acompañamiento del bajo y la bateria. Quisas de el disco ""a donde me lleva la vida..."" al ultimo, su rock a variado pero la esencia, la alegria de la gente que los sigue siguen intactos."
Huzzah,"This is totally worth the money if you like Nirvana or grunge music in general. ""All Apologies"" and ""Rape Me"" are two totally great songs from the In Utero album but the real reason to get this is the b-side ""Moist Vagina"". It's probably just meant as a joke but it's still a great song."
No Follow Through,Would not know. Second half of order never even arrived. Would not recommend ordering from this group. If I could rate a 0 I would.
DULL!,"I'd heard about this book when the author got a big advance. It is exactly what you'd expect. Some lurid police details, but the thing doesn't MOVE. I ended up skimming parts after awhile. The central conceit is that this guy can write, yet is still a cop. While he has some nice descriptive passages, it is too clearly a ""cop diary"" dressed up as work of genuine nonfiction. Comes off as a gimmick. I can't recommend it."
Way too many errors,a few errors is understandable but this is just sorry... not only are answers in the back of the book wrong but there are errors within example problems too and errors to the answers of those example problems. we have to waste about 10 mins every class period to make corrections to the book. plus you never know if you are doing something correctly cause there is nothing to check your work with.
Not enough ooommph,"The unit works, but doesn't have enough mA to power my DroidX phone. With today's bigger batteries a small charger such as this one isn't very useful."
"Entertaining, Yet Unconvincing","Although an overall good read, I felt that this story lacked any real cohesion, closure, or message. As a Greek-American woman, I am offended by shallow attempts at conveying Hellenism through descriptions of food and myths, as it is overdone and often abused. There is much more to discovering one's roots than that. Hence, we have a maudlin, contrived tale which is a bit hard to swallow by many true Greeks. Nonetheless, the story is entertaining, engaging, and readable. It's just too bad that it's so stereotypical."
Educated,"The premise was intriguing, with an interesting list of subjects to draw a prospecgive viewer into the sale. However, the details are minimally researched, shallow to say the least. Anyone who knows the subject areas is ""turned off"" immediately. If possible, no stars would be given."
Extremely Helpful!,"A truly amazing textbook! Perfect for teaching a genuinely biblical theology of mission. It scores high on doctrinal orthodoxy, exegetical scholarship and apologetic/missionary engagement in the contexts of contemporary global-local realities. A rare combination! It has a defiantly high Christology (YES!), a breath-taking appreciation of the Old Testament's all-too-neglected treasure-trove of teaching for a fully integrated Christian worldview, a surprisingly refreshing exposition of familiar New Testament texts, and an authentically 'global Christian' perspective that holds so much promise for Christianity in the 21st century. This is the kind of Bible-sourced, intelligent, horizon-expanding reading that young Christians worldwide need to read for their theological formation, to live and preach the Gospel of Jesus as Lord and Saviour to their grim and jaded generation. As a teacher of theology, I am thrilled to recommend it!"
Learning XML a review,"I purchased this book because (1) I want to learn XML, (2) I have a great many other O'reilly books and generally they are extremly informative. However, overall I was very disapointed with this book, I must say that I am still reading through it, but so far.. too much woffle, not nearly enough examples and those that are present dont appear to work correctly. Nothing is more fustrating than typing in both XML and an accompanying stylesheet, to find that either the XML will notvalidate because of unrecognised atributes, or that the page will not render sanely. I admit I am using Internet Explorer.. version 5.5 but the XML non-validations using a registered copy of XMLWriter are most fustrating.The ftp site examples also fail to validate or execute correctly.In addition.. am I the only person who has yet to see a practical example of XML in action?? ...All in All.. learning XML is a disapointment."
Tough but good :-),"I'm not normally a big Pilates fan, but I do like Kathy and thought I'd give this a go to mix up my current routine. It's a good solid workout and is good for a pilates beginner (me) to intermediate.I found this very easy to follow and as always, Kathy is a great instructor who cues well and is great to listen to. You almost don't need to look at the screen to see what she's talking about because she describes in detail all the moves ahead of time. There is an aerobic segment to begin, and you engage your core throughout that. With the toning, there is classic dumbbell type exercises and pilates floorwork (use a mat). I really like how you can play this in any order. Doing that keeps it fresh and interesting.Overall, this workout is really quite good - I think it's perfect for beginners to intermediate and I'm sure that if done consistantly, then you'll see results. I certainly felt this for a day or two afterwards. Can't wait to try this for my second time."
Unwilling Pooch,My dog would not get into the bed. The bed would also not stay upright so everytime I put him into the bed it rolled over which freaked him out more. This seemed like such a great idea especially since I have a dog who loves to burrow. Unfortunately it turned out to be a disappointing waste of money.
Weird but humorous!,"Some of the stuff is just gross. Yet again, this is not for kids! A grand majority is funny or amusing or even informative. A cool book to use as a guide for when you are feeling bored."
"Our second TETON bag, and just as great","I bought this one for my wife after getting a slightly larger one (Teton Sports 5200 Internal Frame Backpack) for myself. This one seems to fit everything she needs, plus some. I was surprised at the amount since it only holds 55 liters instead of 85 liters of 5200 series one. Both my wife and I love this backpack (as I use it when she doesn't go and it is a shorter backpacking trip where I don't need my 85 liter bag).The quality is great, the straps can be adjusted to perfectly fit your body frame and size. We attach aCamelBak 100-Ounce UnBottlehydration pack to it, making it perfect for any length backpacking trip."
The Kid Kicked Butt,I love this movie to death. If you love old school Kung Fu movies. This is a must.
"Uplifting, Inspiring, Motivational reading","This book will maintain and keep the inspiration to moving forward in times of challenge and conflict. It helped me to stay on focus when my challenges appeared and discouragement could have settled in. Joel's demonstration of his love and trust in God was impacting on me and my perspective changed each time I read a new chapter. When negative thoughts attempted to enter, with sleep disturbance including anxiety, or any other obstacle I was able to use Joel's positive influence with God's love and settle back into a peaceful state."
Not as good as the brand name product,"This product does not compare favorably to Muro 128 ointment. The base is too thick. It actually made my night-time dry eye pain worse, rather than better. Muro 128 works well for me."
Beware!,"I read the reviews and thought, they can't be that bad. Well I should have listened. The fabric is nice, however the zippers get caught and you have to back track a lot, and the pull bars don't come out on all of them. this company sent the product with no invoice and no return label. These suit cases are only used for overnight trips now and will never see the inside of an airplane. I will never buy form this company again."
It lives up to the Reviews,"Like almost everyone on here, or at least the ones that have had the unit for just over a year, mine has stopped working. My wife and I got this from Bed Bath & Beyond and enjoyed the unit and liked how it looked next to our bar. But a year passed and one day it just stopped working, no lights, no fans, nothing at all. We were out of town when it happened and figured that the person watching the house had left the door slightly open and the motors overheated. Then we saw the reviews online and it confirmed the problem.This item is great to look at and the perfect height to set next to most bar settings in your home, but its not worth 200, which we paid, if you KNOW its going to break down after a year. I mean there isnt even any surprise at this point, if you buy one its going to break."
Vauge,"The stuff in this book is explained in a complex manner. Though it is well organised it lacks clear representation. It looks like linux man-pages are explained in an organised manner. Could be used as a reference book, but not for learning."
The Shadow: Shadow Strikes/Int'l Crime DVD,"Bought it as a gift for Jill's Dad and he loves it. Sweet quality, good sound, and he actually was happier the next day after watching it. Very, very happy with the whole presentation of this product."
MISSING VIDEO,"I -ONLY- bought this CD because of the promised video of ""Thank You Maked Man"". This is NOT the ""enhanced version"" as promised. The Thank You Masked Man [CD-ROM Track] is missing from the disc."
Horrible,"Cheap, uncomfortable (top folds into your toes and pinches/slices into the top of your toes/foot). Might be easier to move and run in a pair of ski (not snowboard) boots. Put your money towards a better pair."
A FALSE DEPICTION AND REALLY BAD ACTING,Don't waste you money on this - the acting is beyond awful - totally cheesy - and makes MJ and Elizabeth Taylor look like phony idiots. The makeup is really bad also - it couldn't be worse. The whole thing leaves you with a sicking feeling about the man we love. It should be boycotted by all true MJ fans. Really horrible.
Oversized Mouse = Clumsy Use,"My hands are huge and I think this mouse is way too big. The design raises your palm to high for commanding use. The optical eye is great just like a normal mouse, but it can't be raised off a surface at all. A rolling ball mouse still tracks and spins when lifted off its surface--not good for gaming. I think the design had this problem in mind, so there are no edges and the base is wider. I think Microsoft knows this so they have made a smaller one with optical eye so get that one."
"Not the most important punk album, but probably the most fun","Absent is the cartooniness that made the Ramones impossible to take seriously. In addition, another thankful omission is the overbearing rage and political grandstanding that make people take the Pistols and the Clash too seriously. Basically, this is arguably the best garage band ever(at least on this album), and they're flooring it on almost every tune with a punk energy that's rarely been rivaled. ""(I'm) Stranded"" is a great song, but ""Messin' with the Kid""(slow, grungy rocker), ""Erotic Neurotic"", ""No Time"", the cover of ""Kissin' Cousins"", and ""The Story of Love"" are its equal. The best tune - in my opinion - ""Night in Venice"", buries most punk songs with its potent, chord-ripping fury, and makes a great finale to a great album. The extra songs are good too. There's not a weak track here, and for a punk rock album, that speaks volumes."
"By the time the action picked up, ...just kidding! It didn't.","This is a big nothing-burger of a book, full of characters you don't care about and plotlines that don't move.It's like watching video from closed-circuit cameras for hours. And hours. and hours. It just doesn't go anywhere.Before page 200, I had stopped caring about the politician, the protectors, the bad guys, and the inter-departmental government feuding. Just... make... it... end.Yawn."
Simply Jane,Another amazing masterpeice! i hope only this will continue. Jane's Addiction is one of the best bands of all time. This cd is so amazing i don't know how to put it into words. GO BUY IT!
It grinds too coarse.,The Grinder is well made and we have had it for 5 years. But it never ground the coffee fine so you end up using more beans than you might with another product. We are retiring our Bunn. There is nothing more I would want than an american made coffee grinder. But this one is incapable of producing a fine grind for espresso.
Dead after 4 months!,"So I actually upgraded to the Bytecc 350 after another enclosure failed. This one worked great for a good 4 months or so (although I must say the ""fashion led"" light is extremely annoying). Then all of a sudden the enclosure started beeping at me and my PC no longer recognized the drive. I tested the HD (Seagate 80 GB) in a different PC and it's working fine. Still no response from Bytecc customer service. I am done with external enclosures. I am going to go with a full external hard drive from Maxtor, at least they will respond to support requests!"
fun fun fun,"This CD stands out in my collection like a sore thumb. It's not jazz, it's not blues, it's not an improvisational statement. None of the players will ever make the Rock & Roll hall of fame. It's simply a great rock record. It's fun, it's dopey, and it's loud. Just the way a dopey rock record should be"
was not pleased with the Spenco pads,"I wasn't real pleased with these pads. There were no instructions as to how they were to be inserted in the shoe and in fact I felt the pain in my foot was worse. When I took my 4 mile walk, I had to stop twice, once to adjust the pad and after about 3 miles, had to finally remove the pad. Very disappointed, especially after reading other reviews from people that loved them. As for me, I would never buy them again."
Excellent book,"This is an excellent introduction to hyperbolic geometry. It assumes knowledge of euclidean geometry, trigonometry, basic complex analysis, basic abstract algebra, and basic point set topology. That material is very well presented, and the exercises shed more light on what is being discussed. Plus, solutions to all the exercises are at the end of the book."
The Big Chill CD,"Awesome music....loved the movie and this is a flash back to the past.Great tunes to dance to, cuddle to, etc."
The Tragic Cost of Selling Out,"Once upon a time, Steve Miller was a musical force - though at the time, he got little airplay. From ""Children of the Future"" through ""Number 5"", the Steve Miller Band made great music.The came a troubled period, followed by ""The Joker"". With this album, he set his sights on breaking the Top 40, and while he succeeded, it was hardly admirable work (not an uncommon tale among those who trade respect for profit).""Fly Like An Eagle"" continues that pattern of pandering to the lowest common denominator - a pattern he seems determined to maintain.If you'd like to know what the man is actually capable of, I recommend ""Sailor"", ""Brave New World"", or ""Your Saving Grace"" (sadly, out-of-print)."
A horrible misreprentation of Clapton's career,"Considering that this compilation only covers Eric Clapton's career after 1981, I suppose I can't complain too much about the choice of material. But it is still painful to hear former ""God"" Clapton ape Michael Jackson on ""Change The World""...he might as well have been singing ""Heal The World"" while trying to keep his nose in place, and his older material, which consists mainly of slick pop-rockers and lounge-like ballads, is overproduced and sounds lifeless and bland.If you are just looking for a single-disc compilation, go for ""The Cream of Clapton"", which, although not perfect, is much, much better."
absolute crap,"ok so i bought this figuring it will help me with essays and homework. I firgured this would not be the best, but would do its job and that what i wanted. Well it doesnt. First of all the dictionary isnt completely accurate. The Thesaurus and calculator are good. When this came to my door, i was expecting something smaller, and more sleek. This is huge (bigger than my hand) heavy and the letters are huge. They take up the whole screen, so you have to scroll to the sides and up and down to read the words. Overall its junk, its not worth the money, get something a bit more so its worth the money."
vietnam still haunts,"After all these years, i still am haunted about the American war in Vietnam and ""Code Name Copperhead"" is another source of bringing old memories to the front. Thirty three years after returning from Vietnam I wrote about my experiences as a surgeon and company commander in that war, ""Delta Six, Soldier Surgeon"". I was writing about guys like Sergeant Major Joe R. Garner, men who did their job with honor, dignity, and skills that were legendary. Thank you Joe, for what you did for us, and I am sorry you didn't get the post duty accolades you deserved. Unlike other wars, the soldiers returning from the battlefields of ""The Nam"" seemed to be blamed for the war.You told it like it was and always will be. We are proud of what we did for our country even though it seemed thankless at the time. God bless you Joe.Rick SniderAuthor ""Delta Six, Soldier Surgeon"""
A Patriot's History,"The seller responded quickly, and the book was exactly as described. Highly recommend purchasing from this seller."
Verbose and rather boring,"I struggled through this novel hoping it would improve, and towards the end - it did somewhat, but it still put me to sleep several times! Being the first in a new series by Perry I was prepared to make allowences, but in the end I was disappointed with her new WW1 direction. Perhaps ""Shoulder the Sky"" will be better."
"I'm NOT deaf, but it would HELP","Geez, talk about people in denial. This DVD is the worst thing I've seen or heard from Josh Groban. Like the MAJORITY here, I found it severely wanting. The vocals by Groban are terrible, with the nasal weakness quite obvious. Add the erratic filming, lousy sound and nothing else worth getting excited about. I returned my DVD within 4 days. I only had to see it once. Hope Groban realizes the large audience (beyond these fanatics) will not accept, or BUY such a crummy excuse for music or entertainment."
Batteries suck,"The sony batteries in this pack are really bad. After recharged, they can only stand for few days even without using."
An enjoyable read,"When I purchased this book I didn't realize that it was part of a series, so I will have to go back and read the other two. Still, I found the book interesting and entertaining. A previous review stated that the gods were infantile, but when compared to the antics of the Greek and Roman gods, it's no different. Also, since I have just finished the Shadowdale trilogy and started the Avatar trilogy, I was intrigued to get a little more understanding of the various planes and realms the gods inhabit and a hint of the vastness of the ""multiverse"". This book is written a lot different than the others I have read from the Forgotten Realms, adding to its charm (probably why I enjoyed ""The Night Parade"", too). If you're looking for something a little different, then this book might be for you."
Better off buying HU or Deer Hunter 2005!,"It isn't as if the technology isn't available either...the game just really lacks on all sides...story line is off, graphics are low tech for this day and age, and the animals move like stick figures at best! What is worse is; the game is a SUPER BAD take off of the Cabela's series! I was nearly offended for Cabela games!Best I advice I can give perspective buyers is: buy Any one of the four games of Hunting Unlimited or ANY of the Deer Hunter series games and/or Trophy Hunter games...at least you WON'T be throwing out your money!"
My daughter loves it!,"I was out shopping with my daughter and showed her a variety of toys. This was the one that she instantly went for, so we bought it. That was almost 2 months ago, and it's still one of her favorites. She loves to hear it rattle, and she loves chewing on its tail. She is fascinated by the lion's big, bright smiling face. She'll hold it out in front of her in both hands and ""talk"" to it.This may not be the most exciting toy--no bells and whistles--but it's cute, bright, and cuddly, and my daughter obviously adores it, so I would definitely recommend it."
A must read for Thriller fans.,"I'm a little late on my review but I just had to get a plug in for Lee Child. In my opinion Lee Child is an unsung mystery/thriller writer. His novel ""The Enemy"" is prequel to the rest of the Jack Reacher's series going back to his army days in the early 1990's.What follows is a terrific military police procedural that finds Reacher pursuing a case that involves a cover-up in the USA and Europe. This exciting story could only be told by the talents of Lee Child. A must read for all thriller fans."
Why isn't this movie any good?,"+ Good Cast+ Good Character (B level super hero veiled in mystery for many of the unitiated comic book readers such as I)+ Big Budget+ Lot's of bad and great super-hero movies in the very recent past to take ques from.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why is this movie so bad?I am not a comic book guy, so I can't discuss any narrative issues, but I struggled to keep my eyes open for the last 2/3 of the movie. The story & its characters were weak, and I found the special effects to be bright, shiney, and stuff I saw in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. I loved the Dark Knights & X-Men (First Class in particular) and don't understand why these two very successful but different movies aren't setting the pace for those making the Green Lantern, Thor, & Captain America all but unwatchable. I am very nervous about the Avengers."
Stirring your brains (subliminal wooden spoon),"Have any of you hardcore fans (or any fans of music with a good amount of screaming) ever seriously thought about how stupid it is. I thought the point of music was to take your mind off the chaos in the world, or open your eyes to it, not to be punched in the head so many times you cannot make out your face and your eardrums burst.Grow some common sense on your sorrow and pity tree"
keep looking,I am just completing this book and it was surprisingly filled with sweeping statements that do not ring true.There is very little insight about the killers to be found in this book.The interviews and letters are dull and lacking in information.The one interesting thing I learned from the book was that both Gacy and anotherserial killer had Klinefelters syndrome. So now I have saved you the trouble ofpurchasing and reading it.
Gerbils chewed this up - aquarium better!,"Our gerbils chewed through two of these, so I bought a cheap aquarium and purchasd a gerbil-cage aquarium top (cheap too) at Pet Smart. I filled 1/4 of the aquarium with the soft gerbil bedding (Carefresh), and our gerbils LOVE it! They dig tunnels, and make roofs for the tunnels out of the paper towel roles we give them. They they climb through the one plastic tunnel that comes with the cage top, and eat and run on their wheel on the top level. The kids love watching them run around, and now, whenever they hear us, they come up to the top and take treats from our hands. They are truly happy in this environment!"
WARNING---MISLEADING LISTING,"I ordered this item expecting it to be 3 Die Hard videos, but what it is is two of the movies and a third video about how the movies were made. Very disapointing, especially as this was a gift for a Bruce Willis fan. Item description should be more exact!"
Poor quality prints,"I like the bowery boy, but the quality of these transfers are questionable. It would be nice to see a decent print of these films with half way decent audio quality."
Deliciously Funny,"I bought the VHS tapes of this series after they became available. Now that I have worn them out, I am going to purchase the DVD's of this series. I entitled this review as ""Deliciously Funny"" as you savor every moment of this series rather than just watch it. It's brilliantly funny and is my favorite British comedy series of all time. The way Lucia pronounces ""Lobster à la Riseholme"" is just plain funny in itself."
no one has ever read the bible,"Jesus""If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters--yes, even their own life--such a person cannot be my disciple.Luke 14:26"
Great show.... in person and on DVD :),"I went to this show back in February with a friend, but was not initially going to go. I enjoyed it immensely, and the fact it was being filmed was great also! I had never been to a filmed concert before. One thing that you may not know, is that at the actual show, things were kinda messed up. The whole opening sequence went wrong when the dancers came down on the elevated platforms. When they got to the bottom, Janet et al. just walked off stage! We then had to wait a bit, and a guy came out and explained they were going to do it again! It was rather funny, but I'm sure Janet was mad! So what you see on the dvd, was actually a spliced version of two different opening sequences since the pyrotechnics did not occur the second time around. Anyway, the concert was ace, and I would recommend this DVD to anyone into Janet or the current state of Pop/R&B music today."
I loved this book,"This is definately one of my favourite books of all time. I could not put it down. It was easy to read and I always wanted to turn the page to see what strange twist would happen next. The story is about three girls, Hannah, Vivian and Wren, and how they grew up in a small town with slightly dysfunctional families. This book is beautifully written and I would recommend it to anybody who loves reading!"
"Outstanding lyrics, they tell a story you can visualize","This guy is really special. He tells stories that put you in a place and time. Billy's music is intelligent, fun and keeps on giving you new things to think about. This guy has star power. Really special new artist"
Loved by this reading specialist,"I'm a reading specialist and author (""Teaching Kids To Read for Dummies""). If your child is beyond beginners books, like Bob Books and Dr Seuss, but isn't ready for chapter books, like Bailey School Kids, here's the perfect bridging series. I have the whole Solo series and use it with nearly every child I teach. The stories are great, the books have short chapters so kids can feel proud to be on chapters, the illustrations are lovely. Solo Books have won awards, and deservedly so."
Chokaytomhanks,"Stuhrling Men's Odyssey Skeleton Watch #131.33151Magnificent, my first automatic timepiece and I choose Stuhrling for it's great quality, function, and excellent value!"
Why is most Christian fiction so lame?,"If you're hooked on the LEFT BEHIND series, then I guess you have to read this one too. But if you'd like to read a much more intelligent book on the subject, I recommend THE EZEKIEL OPTION by Joel C. Rosenberg or the books of THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY by James BeauSeigneur."
.,"""People who thought they couldn't draw - but after learning from this book the work was pro quality. "" This reviewer has managed to stuff portraiture into a neat little shake and bake package.Of course their art would look ""pro"" if a teacher is behind you correcting each line out of place! However,creating portraits of people, by yourself is something which requires practice, hundreds and hundreds of hours. I don't think it is fair to say that this book will make beginners, ""pro"". That is wishful thinking and a total belittlement of art! I have to agree with the first review, the art does look mediocre. It would probably suit a beginner, but obviously disappoint someone a little more skilled."
My Voice is a waste of money...,"I purchased My Voice software thinking, ""They have finally made this technology available at an affordable price"". Not so, there are two things you should know about about this product. One, it is very easy to use, you just click on the play button for a song and click on the voice extracter icon (the hand with the microphone). Two, when you click on the hand with the microphone, all you get is your song (voice and all) with the sound turned way down and slightly muffled. The bottom line is, this product does not work. I was extremly disappointed, however, since I did not pay that much for the item I was not livid! I gave it one star, instead of zero, because the product will play your CDs and it will find the names of the songs on your CDs."
"No ""All New Commentary"" by Oliver Stone!","Be prepared for a disappointment, as this DVD doesn't include the ""all new commentary from director Oliver Stone"", merely reusing the one from the previous disc. The other additional features are great, but does not outweigh the disappointment, nor the fact that the title isn't really remastered that well from it's previous transfer."
Outstanding product!,"I bought this product because my gas cans have those lousy low emission spouts. Well, that doesn't matter anymore as I use the siphon now instead. Today it took me exactly two thrusts into the gas can to get the siphon started. And, it empties the can faster than the spout. It just doesn't get any easier than that. Well worth the price."
Great look,One of the best watches I have ever owned. Nice to look at. It's not too large and overpowering. The white face is very easy to read. The night viewing is also excellent. Can be read easily with no light at all. Can't go wrong with this watch. I have owned it for almost a year and a half and have not had any problems at all.
unenlightened,"While Ms Armstrong is very well researched on Christian and Moslem beliefs and customs, her understanding of Judaism was not as strong and it was quite apparent in my read thru. Ms Armstrong presents an out dated view of Judaism with a revengeful and jealous G-d. She would be best served by visiting an Aish Hatorah web site the next time she chooses to write about this subject."
a kid's review,"I think as a HUGE Star Wars fanatic, if you are a collector, this saber is an acceptable addition to your cllection. Of course, if your a child (who really LOVES to battle with electronic lightsabers), I truly reccomend an electronic lightsaber. A Force FX lightsaber is much too delicate, especially for battle."
GUIDED BY VOICES,IT'S MY FIRST TIME DOING THIS BUT I HAVE BOUGHT 2 CD'S BY GUIDED BY VOICES -EARTHQUAKE GLUE AND THE BEST OF.THEY GROW ON YOU AND GET BETTER EACH TIME LISTENING TO THEM.NEVER HEARD OF THESE GUYS. HEARD THEM ON THE RADIO AND HAD TO INVESTIGATE.AL STEWART STILL IS THE MAN.
Boring,"Had to quit after 100 pages or so... not enough information about Neil, the author talks about everything but Neil. Needs more editing."
GREAT MOVIE!,"It has a stupid title. but honestly I think its better than the origional Thunderball. Actually its a remake of it. Kim Basinger did a wonderful job as ""Domino"". I liked how the director toyed with the fact that James Bond is older than he was in the 60's. It all together turned out to be a wild, thrilling, action packed Connery film."
Little Giant Dog Feeder,"I bought this feeder for outdoor use, but every time it rains the dog food inside the feeder gets wet and I have to clean it out. I was forced to put it under a shelter. May be ok for indoor use, but in that case, the magnetic door is pointless."
Senior Saints study,Book is excellent for Christians (individual or groups) growing older who need to find continued significance and value in what they do.
"Good for party, not for true talent","Ciara is the type os singer that has a Cd full of songs that you want to crank up at a party. If you are listening for some real vocal challenging music to listen to, this is not the album. She is not the best singer in the world. None of her songs are vocally hard. She is doing good for her first album but comparing her to Janet, now isn't that just setting her standards a little to high. There will only be one Janet and she always make sure she let people know that. If you are looking for some party cranks, get this album but if you are looking for some good singing, You will waste your money."
"How these guys got labeled as ""Emo"" I'll NEVER know...","I think these guys have a lot more in common with Bowling for Soup than any Emo/screamo band I've ever heard. They're just another powerpop/punk band, but a pretty good one at that. This CD's pretty solid all the way through. If you like catchy hooks, driving beats and/or a Creed-like guitar sound, you'll dig this."
Plastic not brass,"I received this promptly, but it was plastic, not brass, always read reviews before makimg a selection. Picture at webpage is brass."
"com""YULE""ation Cleric: Zeal for Zema`s Zenith","What a challenge ? Conceptualize the beauty and spirit of cold winter nights. Well to my ear, these instrumental interpretations distill that chill in the air and render a meaning from the twinkling stars.Eight songs are original, five imaginary revisions of seasonal standards, and two inclusions of popular pop tunes stripped of vocals yet bellowing like the changing wind. The talented trio of artists creative echoing of a fresh blanket of snow and the darkness of night upon melody, their quite complexity between percussion and other playables,and their use of todays mixing techno all combine to answer. .... Post Script~ Great background seasonal drumel and even better headphone dozing.buyit...save it..."
Gives me a stomach ache,"I've tried this mouth wash three times and each time ended up with a stomach ache, so I discontinued use. I was really hoping to find a natural mouth wash, but this isn't it for me."
A True Economist!,Hal Varian is a true economist: he has the ability to state the obvious in terms of the incomprehensible!
"New Packaging ""Not for use in flashlights""","I recently bought these batteries because i needed new batteries for a flashlight. When the product arrived their was a small white sticker that said, ""Not for use in flashlights"". The description that Amazon has does not say that. Considering it would cost more to ship back than i paid for them i decided to try it. I only have turned my flashlight on for a few seconds at a time, but so far it is still bright. I don't know why they the new packaging said ""not for use in flashlights""."
6 per case??,"I like the product just fine, but assumed that I was going to be receiving 6 containers and not one. The product description said 6 per case, so I assumed this would be a case of 6 20ct. containers. It was only 1. Just FYI."
Noll has great voice. But this album failed to move me.,One way I evaluate a CD is by the degree to which I am motivated to give it repeated listenings. While I was impressed by Christiane Noll's voice -- she can hit those high notes without screeching-- there was something missing in this CD. I just couldn't get involved with the songs. I have no desire to listen to it again. Therefore the low number of stars. If Miss Noll puts out another CD I will check it out. I like her voice. But this particular one didn't hit the mark.
Are we listening to the same CD?,"Chaos and Creation is a dreadful dirge of McCartney sappiness. The songs are an endless blend of ballads where it's hard to hear where one song picks up and the other leaves off. I'd like to here McCartney make some rock-n-roll again. Maybe he could team up with Ringo Starr, who could show him how it's done. All of you who like this CD are probably the same ones who liked Brian Wilson's ""Smile"", another example of washed up old musicians who just don't know when to retire."
Interesting experience.,"If you want to read a boast about oneself - this is it. The book is Bill Gates patting Bill Gates on the back. It makes some curious and interesting forecasts but underneath it all, its a BOAST."
What the fiction is this?,"I tried, and unfortunately I fell int that group of people that could not follow ALL of the different view points and changes and what is the point of this story, really - I followed book one just fine, but once into book two, it was like starting over and I felt let down that I invested time into a book and found by that point a new book - and a totally different angle on EVERYTHING - yeah, so I quit - so sue me - i just can not deal with a book that has more person point-of-views than there are days in the week - sorry - too much jumping around - next time, it should be separate novels in the same world, not multiple novels within one binding."
I feel cheated,I bought this DVD because I thought it would contain spoof's of Star Wars for my son. He and I both thought that was on there and both of us were terribly disappointed (a 7 year old does not understand about marketing)I am appalled that Fox would sink this low and deliberately try to cheat people.. If I want to see the Simpsons we turn on the TV! I for one now have a bad taste in my mouth when it comes to Fox and I will never ever buy another DVD from them. (it is not the money I spend .. it is the principal that a company took advantage of people and stoop so low)
solid text w/ great detail,huge quantities of social history from a very specific time period. of particular note is the information on the role of women in the business/ social structure of the community. highly recommended for every english medievalist.
Still unsure,I'm still unsure about this one. I'm starting to think that the whole Spider-Man thing is played out. I'm never a fan of re-making a movie when it was just re-made. I know the story line was different but I have a hard time separating the new guy from the last guy. I don't know. It was okay.
Poor non-stick pan,"I have used this pan only twice, the eggs stick badly. I have my everyday set of stainless pots and pans and bought this for cooking eggs and a few other items. It is a very light weight pan and of very poor quality. I generally have liked my calphalon pans, but this seems to be a knock-off item. It is very light weight and is not a non-stick cooking pan. You get what you pay for."
good popcorn book,"Take this book for what it is. It's a by the numbers action/adventure story. It you can get past that and suspend your disbelief (especially when it comes to Tor-Tor) you'll really enjoy this tale of non-stop jungle adventure. There is plenty of action, violence, and gore. I listened to the book on cassette and the reader does a great job of using different voices, expression, and inflection. It would make a great popcorn movie."
They dont mail this out.,I just cancelled my subscription.I ordered this magazine around September of 09. Never received a copy until I contacted Amazon. Got one copy and it was shredded beyond use. Magazines suggestion was to contact my post office. I get everything else just fine through my post office. My suggestion is better. Cancel.
SCARY!!!,"This cd is too *#@%# scary for me and I'm 38 years old!! If you are really into scaring kids, this will do the trick."
Not What I Expected,"As a biologist, I was hoping for more Lemur biology than what I got. This book is an excellent history of Madagasacar, without a doubt, and includes detail I am sure is found nowhere else. If one were planning a trip to Madagascar, this would be a perfect primer.However, I was hoping for more of a biological approach regarding the Lemurs, their society, behavior, etc. While I did get a taste, it wasn't enough.Sorry to admit, I got just over half way through the book before I lost interest."
"imaginative, jazzy MPB","This instrumental album shimmers with textures and ideas. I was drawn to this project after loving his arrangements on Caetano's Livro album, and this one doesn't disappoint. It is sophisticated and jazzy in its arrangements, benefits from the ornate pulses that bless so much Brazilian pop, and my main criticism is that I wish it were longer.All original tunes by Luiz Brasil except one, a fantastic rearrangement of Noite Perpetua."
Flimsy but cheap,"This tripod is too short (I virtually always use it extended to full height, including the head), too flimsy (it struggles to hold my Canon 400D still, even with a small lens), and difficult to adjust (the same camera is virtually impossible to hold at much of an angle). The removable head is also a bit flimsy. However, it's also light, and ridiculously cheap. Don't pay more than $15 for it, and you won't be disappointed."
Doesn't keep cold but good for transport to sitter,I use this to transport Dr. Brown 8oz bottles. I've put two ice packs and another one in the top compartment and it only seems to keep them cold for 2 or 3 hours. I use them to get to the sitter's and then she removes the bottles and places them in her fridge. I wish this would work for road trips but sadly it doesn't hold up to long rides. A for effort though. I do use this daily.
Good to see,"It is good to see people giving there honest reviews and saying what they feel. Although the game looks great I am one person who believes in protesting. If more and more people said ""NO"" and refused to buy games from EA and their counter productive measures Companies would realize they need to change their tactics. The fact is these companies know that no matter what they do people will continue to take it in the shorts and buy their games instead of protest it and say No we will not tolerate this.It's like anything keep feeding the virus and it will continue to grow bigger and stronger. Unfortunately EA has a bunch of great games under their name but I REFUSE to buy them and will buy from other game vendors ONLY. Anyone ever try to get ahold of EA by phone? I rest my case.Please review previous reviews in the same time frame to understand what my review is about with EA."
Good price delayed Sound,"These cables have a good quality video but in my case my sound gets delayed by about a half second. I use mine from my computer to my TV, I don't know if there are similar results going from a DVD or bluray to the TV. But I bought 3 of these and still glad that I did."
Much needed humor for today,"This is a good book ... although I do get rather tired of ""politics"" myself. Love the guy's humor and candor and the way he could talk with anybody."
Extremely Bad Movie Making,"This film is a pathetic excuse for film making. It is boorish, trite and a regurgitation of the same theme over and over ad nauseum. No suspense, no scares etc.. Everything is telegraphed in advance. The film is infantile at best. The acting is atrocious and amateurish, but what you expect in a low quality film like this. Their attempts at humor in the film border on the childish and moronic. The only humorous thing about this film is that the people involved are so deluded that they think they produced a good piece of work. It is hilarious to think that a film company wasted valuable money in today's economy on a joke of a film. This dvd isn't worth 11 cents much less 10.99..If you want to get value for your money, buy the original 2000 maniacs film and not these cheap cardborad regurgitations and reimaginings. The original was a trailblazing film unlike this pile of dung."
Not Worth the money or the time,Amateur job...looks like a home movie and a waste of money. It doesn't really tell you any more than the actual information you can get from online or from NCL. I would not recommend this unless you're into watching someone's home video.
"Ultimately, who cares?","Although this book was quick and somewhat engaging, when I completed it I was left wondering what I had just read. The character development is so anemic that you don't care about Carrie, Mike, Kilroy, Rooster, or any of the other main players. The best one in the whole thing was the mom, who at least spoke some sense once in awhile, but who rarely made an appearance and was never fleshed out. I was waiting for some major symbolic meaning to emerge in the use of the sewn garments (nightgown/robe and green velvet dress) but it never surfaced. We never find out what makes Kilroy tick, and the cliched description of New York was too much! Overall, not worth the time spent reading it."
amazing empathy with this book,"Just what I was looking for to help lift my next 'layer' or that 'blocking' feeling. I highly recommend this book. Using the 'script' as instructed, really helped my spirit."
Mostly PETA propaganda.,"lousy writing, no real story. Obviously written by an animal rights advocate. I like animals too but good grief Charlie Brown. Did not hold my interest long enough to finish the book. Glad I didn't pay full price."
"Nice, but not the best ever...","This movie is pretty good overall, but still there's minor action, like a few gunfights, one Apache encounter, and so on. I'm not saying this is bad, but I'm saying: if you really think about it, it's not the best ever made. For example, ""Chisum"" and ""Stagecoach"", which are both John Wayne movies, have way more action. Besides, why did Wayne play such a small part in this video? It would have been much better had he played a longer part. Also, if you want better movies, there are two ""Stagecoach"" movies. Watch the John Wayne one, because of the singer in the color movie. Another example is ""True Grit"", and ""Rooster Cogburn"". I won't give any more examples, because I wouldn't have a well written review. But what I can say is that you should watch this movie, and there are better ones, but this is a neat one. Enjoy!"
Good? Not so much.,"The author of this book spent part of his career in the British Isles and part in the United States, and it shows. Unless you plan to practice speech pathology in Scotland, I would skip this one. The best approach to a beginning phonetics class is to learn the basic phonemes in terms of their transcription and placement. This book, however, introduces phonemes with lesser-used (at least in the U. S.) symbols and unhelpful references. The inclusion of European examples is especially confusing."
mica panel heater,Product worked well for 2 months and then quit-DeLonghi said to cut the cord off and mail it to them and they would replace the heater for a $15 service shipping charge. Amazon Verified Purchase
Poorly built,"The unit lasted 5 months and one burner quit altogether. After countless attempts I was finally able to reach Aroma, who agreed to take it back and fix it (at my shipping cost) and return it...in 4 weeks. Hardly worth the time and expense. I'd look for a different brand next time"
Very good holster,I was very impressed by the quality of this holster. It is a holster that needs no break in. I love the way it looks and retains my Ruger Vaquero. I would recommend this holster to everyone.
Practice for the Boards,"I don't know which book the Oct 2000 reviewer was looking at, as my copy of this book is nothing but explanation of answers. This is a useful book for people who learn well from testing their knowledge through question and answer, however be sure to supplement this with more up-to-date sources such as Qbank, First Aid 2003 or Step Up to make sure you focus on the more pertinent subject matter and not minutiae! Good luck on the boards!"
"The Raj Quartet, Volume 1","Would like more background on the true history of India, the three sects and how the British screwed another country up."
I Spy Fantasy - fantastic fun!,"Great game for a 4 to 8 year old. Fun for the adults helping too!Three different areas to explore: Space travel, Underwater adventure and medieval castle(rescuing a trapped princess, no less).A close second to the excellent 'I Spy Spooky Mansions'.One minor quibble. For the European market the designers of the game should have ditched the american kid's voice, and use a less grating English accent."
great gate and affordable!,"We've been using this gate for approximately 6 weeks now to block a 58"" space between our living room and kitchen. Despite having to drill 16 holes for the screws, it was still installed in under 15 minutes. I don't understand the negative reviews regarding the latching mechanism. It couldn't be easier. My disabled 65 year old mother has no problem closing and opening this gate. Although the gate feels a little flimsy, my daughter has shaken it pretty hard and it has held up just fine. Definitely worth the $40."
Only the 2nd book I could not finish!,"I could not get through this book. It required a dictionary on almost every page. I think the author wrote this with a Thesaurus to be original. Original he was, I got to page 127 and said that is enough! The story line did not flow at all. The author makes a 9 year old girl talk and sound like an adult.I read the previous reviews before I purchase this book. I must have gotten the wrong book, but the author and title are the same. Sorry I do not agree with the previous reviews."
Not happy,"This is a cheaper drive than I expected. I contacted tech support about some problems I had with this. The rattling noise that really annoys me is caused by the drive heads moving to a resting position where it ""rattles"" harmlessly. They told me its due to the fact its their low end no frills drive. I wouldn't have bought this had I known about the noise. Its very annoying.Also have a problem where the drive doesn't come up on startup. They say sometimes data gets trapped in a buffer, and the drive won't work until it clears the buffer. But since its ""data"" the drive is refusing to purge it. Usually unplugging the power and removing the USB cable for a minute does the trick. But not this time..... I may have a nonfunctioning drive until I can get to a repair shop when they open on monday....Very unhappy right now."
Poor quality,I have had these for 6 months now and they are falling apart. Forget about the lint... they don't last! I had Kmart towels for 6 years and they didn't look this bad!
good reference,"This book has great pictures and easy to follow descriptions that make wiring as simple as possible for a novice like me. We redid our entire electrical system with help from this book, and my only real critique is that the book could use a section on drawing up plans. There are many different symbols that one must be familiar with in order to draw up the appropriate plans to submit for permit to do any major electrical work, and this book is silent on the topic. However, for actually doing the work, this book was indispensable!"
Not quite good enough to buy twice.,"This is a good book, but not one of Jayne Ann Krentz's best. Also, it's not readily apparent that it is a reprint until you check out the copyright page. I bought it in 1988 and again under the new title unknowingly. I wish I had seen these comments first."
Its ok,"Tastes fine, i didn't really notice any difference when taking it but i'm sure it is probably healthy. I don't notice a difference when i take a multivitamin."
excellent,"excellent material, fine stitching and wonderful looks. am very happy. thanks. The texture is so nice it beats all expectations."
Not quite what I expected,"This product gets the baby-fine hairs just great but the whiskery ones takes a lot of work. I find I have to use this device daily to keep on top of new growth. I do not think it will replace my waxing. Overall, this may be fine for some people but for people who have the whiskery hair growth, probably will not work to it's advertised potential. I would be reluctant to try it on my underarms or bikini area."
Disappointment,When I purchased this video it did not note that I would not be able to view it on my kindle. Very disappointing and I would not have purchased it if I had that information.
Great buy for Elvis fans,A must have for Elvis fans. Provided footage I never saw before of the eary days of his career. Well done and would recommend.
life for older computers,"another drive I purchased to transport data from my original "" blueberry"" I-Mac; actually anything up to 1 gigabyte will work; I had to learn this the hard way and purchase a 4GB and a 2GB both of which aren't recognized by this machine...............sbgale"
Sandisk SD HD Memory Card,The memory card is the best price for a 4GB I had bought to date. I now have plenty of memory to take hundreds of pictures on my digital camera. I will buy this card again from the same source.
Everything Old is New Again,This book details many long forgotten skills which may become vital in these uncertain social and economic times. It is listed in my Catholic Rural Solutions Yahoo Group as a must read item.Richard of Danbury
"Looks nice, shaves little.",It simply did not shave well. I took me at least 3 times as long to get a mediocre shave verses my 4 year old shaver. I went for the norelco 8200 series that was more like my old shaver in structure and it works great.
Save your money,"This case is laid out terribly.The mounting holes for the main board don't line up with the with my gigabyte M'board. This leaves an entire side unsupported.There are nice engineering features totally shot in the foot by horrible screw placements, loud fans, and about 3times as many screws as a ""cheap"" midtower case. Plus, the damn blue flashlight used for the power LED. What's with the 10,000 cooling holes that don't line up with any case fan known to man.The case in neither portable, nor small, nor lightweight. There have to be other cases out there that would work out 10x better.This is the last time I waste more than $30 on a case. Just not worth any amount of money.Does it work? Yes. Would I buy it again? Absolutely not!"
This book is fantastic!,"I love this book! I've already finished reading the second in the series, and am waiting on the third as a Christmas gift. I highly recommend it to fans of the genre or author."
was disappointed,The CGI on this one SUCKS!!!! Big Time!!!! I was expecting a live action movie when I heard of this sequel to the sequel to the sequel of the original. I was totally disappointed with both the CGI and the storyline and really wish I hadn't wasted the money I spent on it. :(
I hope they release all of The Muppet Show episodes!,"If you are my age (33) and watched The Muppet show as a kid, I am sure you are going to love it just as much or maybe even more! When you realize the work and artistry that went into each episode and the Muppets, you appreciate the show even more! It is touching how Brian Henson gives introductions for the episodes, there are 3 on this disc, plus some bonus clips.I am a John Denver fan as well and hope that Brian Henson brings all of The Muppet Show episodes to VHS and DVD for this generation and our children. My son loves the Muppets and I am so glad to be able to share with him something I loved as a child with him. Thanks Jim in Heaven! Thanks to Brian Henson for continuing your dads legacy for all kids and for me! Thanks to all of the Muppets!"
Awesome,Great book have listened to and own the entire series. Wonderful story line lots of action and romance. Love the connection of friends and co workers that Eve has. Fairy tale come true. I have all the audios and listen to them when ever I am in my car. I have shared these with friends and they also cannot wait until they can get their hands on the next one.
Great story,I didnt even know the Giver was a trilogy!! The giver was one of my absolute favorite books in High School. Then I found more to the story!! What a treasure! Its a great book. I'm reading the Messenger next. This book is different than the Giver but the stories are connected.
Terribly diappointing,"If you're looking for a continuation of the action from the first nine books, don't bother reading this one. Basically, it reacts to the event which ended the 9th book and advances the story only slightly. I was very disappointed! It seems that Mr. Jordan does not know how to end the story and is only selling books at this point."
Not that bad,"I had to read this book for a summer reading for Honors English. Althought the book is very short, it felt like it took an eternity to get through the first chapter. It wasnt bad though. In the book, Kino, Juana and their son Coyotito are pretty poor, until one day Kino finds a pearl in the Gulf. And basically after that, Kino is driven crazy from the pearl; bad things such as people trying to rob him, their hut burning down, and the baby was killed, but Kino seems obsessed after a while. He refuses to give up the pearl, which the pearlers said was worthless because it was too big. I found the last chapter the most intriguing. One drawback I found was that Steinbeck describes EVERYTHING in such detail, which probably wasnt necessary. But overall.. I say its pretty good."
Uncomfortable and too big,"I've had many pairs of earbuds, and these are terrible. They don't fit in my ear at all (I've never had this problem with any other headphones). The sound quality is ok, but they just don't fit."
Compact earbuds,Liked them right out of the package with no break in. Great high-end like sound for little money. Impressive bass response. Big Bang for the buck.
Correct Size,It is sharp and the correct length and diameter. I bought it to make a hole in a location that had obstructions blocking the drill motor with a shorter drill.
Difficult to watch,"I kept hoping it would get better as it went along, that something would redeem it; no such luck. My copy was garbled and poor quality as well. It looked and sounded more like what I imagine a pirated film would, like a film of a film. Do not buy this. Really bad."
classic toy,"Classic toy- love that the doors can only be opened by using the knobs and that it does not take batteries! My daughter and I will use the toy to learn animal sounds, colors, numbers and operating the various knobs. I just wish I knew a good sound to make for the giraffe!"
HORRIBLE,"Frankly, this is one of the worst movies ever made. It has a flimsy storyline, and Amanda Bynes is a complete horror. Her portrayal of the main character was almost painful to witness.I would never in my wildest dreams think of reccomending this movie to anyone I think of as a friend. This movie is absolute FILTH.It is not even worth one red cent."
Excellent goggles,"They keep the water and chlorine out of my 11-yo son's eyes and he can see very well through them, but he says they are sometimes hard to tighten correctly, which is why they get 4 instead of 5 stars. Overall a BIG win for us!"
Kong Dog Toy,"I have, for years, bought the XL Kong dog toy. They always arrive perfectly 5.5"" toys. These came at 4.5"". Went to PetCO and Pet Smart and their XL are 5.5. Customer service was not willing to acknowledge their error. Will never order from them again. Went on line elsewhere and got them. 5.5"" and this time, red ones, which are neat."
Just not any resemblance to the Vietnam War,"I realize this book received rave reviews, and I also realize I'm biased due to my own war experience as an infantry soldier in Vietnam. While Tim O'Brien is a very gifted writer, I feel the attention paid to this work, especially in the many school systems, is tremendously overblown. The book does not really teach anything about a real war experience to the younger generation, nor to anyone who hasn't experienced battlefield conditions.War novels with some basis in fact are very appropriate, but those with totally fictitious events don't meet my expectations. Every book about war need not be filled with battle documentation, but the tales told here are in my words ""a bit off the wall.""Dave Simmons - Author""Our Turn to Serve - An Army Veteran's Memoir of the Vietnam War"""
Two lemons in a row,"I first bought this humidifier directly from Amazon in December, but it refused to function. The power light came on but the heating element never warmed up (I left it on overnight to be certain). Fortunately Amazon's return service is flawless.I decided to give it one more try, and just received the replacement unit (again, I ordered directly from Amazon). The fill cap was missing from the water tank.No more chances from me! :("
Buy this now.,"I bought this used here on Amazon for $5 and I almost want to send Mr. Barker a check, I feel like I stole it. If you like his illustrations you'll like this book. Barker is obscenely talented, no question about it. WELL worth $20 or so for a new copy, don't hesitate, buy it."
It looks great! It plays somewhat ok.,"The graphics are great for the time when it came out. The action levels when you fly the plane are a lot of fun. The problem is that when you get past that part you run into communication issues. You can't really tell what the game designers want you to do. As of this time I still can't find clues to getting past certain parts of the game.I will say that the puzzles do need some thinking, which is great. When you do figure out how to get past a guard or when you take out a room full of guards is very satisfying."
Too many inaccuracies!,"I studied Titanic all my life and I know pretty much every detail. However when I read this book I found inaccuracies that just cant be ignored. It says that there was a ""brilliant moon"" out but there was no moon. This book also gives the wrong name to the person at the wheel at the time of the disaster. As is mentioned in other reviews, its very repetitve as well. However the cover picture, inside pictures and the survivor accounts are very interesting. (but misquotes dominate)"
Believe the Hype,"I read this book in July of 2004 and thought it was fantastic. I read it on the advice of a coworker who knew my love for the ""Matrix"" genre. I had never heard of the book, but quickly purchased it, and read it in 3 days. I highly recommend it for those who enjoyed the creativity and imagination of the ""Matrix"" movies."
Poor quality video,"I love the movie but the quality of the video is terrible. This was my first time buyign a movie on Amazon Prime, I likely will just stick with buying the movies on iTunes."
"No extra features really, even on bluray...","Blah... trailer, movie, not much different than in theaters. I guess low budget means even much lower budget on the DVD/Bluray. Disappointing."
Simply magnificent!,"I have read a lot of books, but ""Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone"" amazed me. Even though it's supposed to be a book for younger people, I found it incredibly funny and extraordinary. J.K. Rowling has with this book written a masterpiece."
A Review,"A somewhat initially straightforward plot about murder in a rundown clinic,which then leads to something more sinister.This is how best to describe The Zero Imperative,the first in the PROBE series of Doctor Who spin-offs,featuring Caroline John,Linda Lusardi,Colin Baker,Sylvester McCoy,Jon Pertwee and Louise Jameson.The confused ending may be a little hard to follow,but the acting is of a high standard and as such it withstands repeated viewings."
SO REPULSIVE IT RULES,"gore soaked lyrics and unearthly guttural growls broken hope are fine example of gory death/grinding metal.this album is grotesque songs such as siamese screams,auction of the dead ,and the cloning.fans of mortician and cannibal corpse will just love these guys i do they are so awesome that i highly recomend them to fans of this type of stuff ..get this and fill your ears to the max with gory metal.cya"
Metal Gear 4 to much drama!,"It has to much drama! I was bored with the story, it felt like watching a Candy episode, didnt like it!"
And that's just for the gadgets,"I can't believe there was a time when I loved all the Bond films without reservation. Now that they are being rereleased I started to purchase them...and now have stopped. Goldfinger is still briliant, but TSWLM is just vile. Barbara Bach as XXX is a babe, but one of the most vacuous performances on film. I used to slam on Denise (""I get to play a scientist"") Richards in The World Is Not Enough, but compared to Bach she's Meryl Streep with a hot bod. Get a pulse. Roger Moore saunters through this venture in his classic English stoicism with just a bit too much of Al Gore's stiffness. Yes, the gadgets are good, but even they lent themselves to Austin Powers style farce. This flick is too campy for a good action film but not campy enough to be a camp classic. Sad to say, but the more recent Pierce Brosnan Bond flicks far surpass this '70's drivel."
Living History,"Get real. Read Hell to Pay by Barbara Olson, High Crimes and Misdemeanors by Ann Coulton or Dereliction of Duty by Robert Patterson. Then decide for yourself if you want to read Hillary's fictional book."
Mediocre Trap,"I got this to Trap Squirrels as I have too many around, that were getting into my bird feeders. It did a mediocre job of trapping the animals. It did work in that I got rid of the ones getting into my bird feeders and the squirrels left eat the seeds off the ground and do not bother the feeders."
Great book,"I remember my mom made me read this story when I was homeschooled. Carry on Mr Bowditch was a book that I actully enjoyed reading when I was homeschooled. Mr Bowditch is an inspiration. He had the attitude that he could do anything he could put his mind too.I recently saw this book on sale at the library and immediatly snatched it up. I read it for the second time. Which is something I rarely do.And I told my mom that I wish I had the determination that this kid had.I gave this book 4 stars because this book became depressing at times. His mother died, his grandmother, his father(I am assuming died because he was never mentioned after awhile), his sister, his brother in law his two brothers and his first wife.So you see all this death is in the book. But this is a nice book and I enjoyed it."
great magazine with lots of interesting articles,one of my favorite magazines. It's not just a lot of fluff. there are great tips and articles inside too!
Confused,"Was really Confused by this book, Muslim Know who Jesus is they believe in Him & believe that he is coming back. And it didn't mention anything about what happens to the Christians who become Muslim? This book is very unfair & it gives the world the wrong impression of Muslims. Very sad when I read this book."
Decent while it lasted.,"The subwoofer worked well enough for about 6 months ( Not exceptionally big sound but about what you would expect for a 8"" sub).Then it just stopped working. Replaced the fuse and it worked for about 24 hours before it stopped again.Replaced the fuse a couple more times but still no go. Replaced the cable just in case this was the problem but it wasn't. Not too upset since the subwoofer wasn't too expensive but still bummed out all the same."
It covers well if you have enough hair on your head,When I first used it I had enough hair to make it look good. Now a year later it just looks fake on my hair. It also gives me headaches when I use it and leaves clumps of black.
Great performances of delightful Russian music,"Personally, I love 19th century Russian music. And few, if any, conductors equalled Svetlanov in conducting Russian music. Therefore, I have thoroughly enjoyed this varied collection of works which presents a treasure trove of wonderful music -- including some well know works but also many other delightful works which were new to me and, I suspect will be new to other listeners as well. If you too like Russian music, please treat yourself to this delightful 2-CD set."
BEWARE: Carginogenic - Prop65 in the manual.,"The manual says THIS PRODUCT, ITS PACKAGING AND ITS COMPONENTS CONTAIN ONE OR MORE CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER, BIRTH DEFECTS OR REPRODUCTIVE HARM.Garmin fails to advertise this on their website. You gotta buy this product to find out afterwards."
The new Default cd a success,"Just when we were getting ready for the start of December, Default comes out with a new cd to make everything go crazy. The new cd called ""Elocation"" delivers exactly what its name stands for. When you listen to it you depart from the usual state, an ecstasy. Hearing the loud bass of Dave Benedict sounds to the rocking voice of Dallas Smith, every second makes your heart beat faster. Danny Craig delivers serious beats to the wild styles of Jeremy Hora. A must have cd for those into any type of music. Default makes sure everyone can enjoy their cd and they proved it."
Couldn't finish the movie,"Thank God it was a rental. As an American, I could not understand the British lower middle class accent. Poppy does not speak the Queen's English. I didn't know if she was still high/drunk or happy go lucky. I did not make it past driving lesson #1 when it went back to the rental."
Watch out for wireless!,"I loved this unit. Sleek, loud, great sound, and the separate control unit for volume, mic, and treble is very innovative. Unfortunately, as another reviewer stated, the control unit picks up wireless interference. It took me two units to figure this out. At first I thought it was a short in the wires, because the static changed and sometimes disappeared as I moved the control unit around. But when the 2nd unit did the exact same thing, I started shutting down devices in my office until I got to the wireless router. Bam - immediately the static stopped. Makes sense now; it explains why the static changed as I moved the control unit - it is actually picking up interference from the wireless.Unfortunately, the static and clicking is so loud I have to return this one as well.So, this gets a 4, maybe a 5 if you don't have wireless by your PC. But if you do, then it gets a 1. So I averaged the score to 3."
A good book for the exam.,"Yes there are many, many errors and you can't believe what the authors say. However, if you read the preface it states there are errors. In studying for the exam, LEARN THE CONCEPTS, don't memorize the book. Compare what the author's have written vs. the actual help files in Access. Then you will have true confidence when exam time comes. I have just passed the exam and will provide one huge hint. When you get up in morning, open a recordset. When you go to work open a recordset. etc. etc. Open recordsets in every conceivable situation and every conceivable way and understand what the recordset does. And study your eyeballs out!"
Is the Basic Premise really his own?,A question to you all.Isn't Wit's basic premise about language and truth just a slant on Sausseurian linguistics with lots of blather and a critique of his (Wit's) prior incarnation in the Tractatus? (the tractatus being the single most pseudo and naive work in the history of phi in my opinion and Wit's first book.)
Blahhh,"I bought this book expecting the kind of insight and farfetched storys the good doctor is known to write about. This book is merely a group of letters. Letter after letter. After letter.Despite my affinity for HST and his wacky ""I Do What I Want"" attitude, this book merely has me thinking ""Why am I reading this and why do I care"".In his writing, you see his style evolve through the years. But I only found this to be a good toilet book that I can pick up for 10 minutes. I am disappointed.One the up side, I find it pleasant to appreciate his actual letters and see him as a deeper man than before. I give this book 2 stars."
Original Plot. Cliche Characters.,"The plot to this movie is what grabbed my attention the most. The idea of an isolated Japan is a nice modernization of history, and has the level of political complexity that I usually appreciate in a movie. Unfortunately, that was about as far as it went for me with this film. All of the other details were trite and cliche, and too often the characters and the Type-A, military dialog are ripped right out of the typical action movie playbook. The umpteenth attempt at hardened, take-charge personalities that offer a glimmer of sensitivity is, at this point, dull characterization. With such a promising plot-line, there may have been a better angle at the story so that the characters were as original as the plot."
Disappointment,"Not being aware that Mr. Ludlum had passed away, I eagerly purchased this book. What a disappointment! It's a shame to carry on his name in this fashion.In my opinion, the book was quite amateurish, slow and wordy for wordiness' sake (case in point - the meeting in the airport with the guy using (too many!) fractured idioms, e.g., ""kill two fowl with one rock"", ""birds of the same plumage seek out one another's company"", ""all that coruscates (coruscates???) is not gold."") Also, as someone else mentioned, the editing seemed lacking (the gun that was seen beneath a bush, highly accessible, then later is was ""completely inaccessible"").I won't make the mistake again - there are much better choices around."
Green finger...mNferz,"I bought this as a christmas present for my girlfriend. I thought b/c it is sterling silver it would be good to go, but apparently it is just cheap b/c now there is a green ring around her finger. I'm annoyed and want my money back! Now I seem like a cheap-o that can't pick out a good ring...BS."
Not in the same league as The Pirate Lord......,"I really enjoyed The Pirate Lord and was looking forward to reading this book about Sara's infamous brother. Sadly I was disappointed as The Forbidden Lord just did not live up to it's prequel.Jordan is Sara's brother and I did appreciate how this book literally ""picks up right where the Pirate Lord ended"". This is really where my appreciation ends. I liked Emily really well and was in to this story until the blackmail scandal/ultra ego Lady Emma was born. I did not like the ""is she or isn't she Emily"" phase that Jordan painfully goes through. The passion is very real and sensual, but that's all there really was. I believed Jordan ""wanted"" both Emma and Emily, but I didn't believe that he loved either of them...now I'M sounding schizophrenic!Not really excited about The Dangerous Lord...Ian's story. I don't know, maybe if I get bored I'll try it....not overly compelled."
A little too limited in category,"This book would've ordinarily been a very good book, however, with a few of the same kinds of books available at the same time, I believe that you should shop around before purchasing this one. I have looked at several with the same theme and have found that ""Asian Greens"" is more concise and lists 3x more vegetables than this book and offers 30 more recipes than this book. Yes the pictures are very beautiful but so are the ones in ""Asian Greens"". For an informative guide, I would have to go with ""Asian Greens"" -- unfortunately, I picked up this one first and have since bought ""Asian Greens"" to help me pick Asian vegetables at the markets."
Good luck playing it!!,"This game works maybe the first couple of times you play it with acceptable passcodes, then it crashes every time you play it! And good luck getting help from Lucasarts.com--I sent in a request for technical support five days ago and have yet to hear from them!"
"review of stare, jr","The only thing different we do is.. after we miss a question, we continue reading the rest of the questions to see how many we remember."
I might be the only one in the UK but I did not enjoy this book,"Although the storyline was good in principle - Jamaicans coming to 1940' England expecting to find the promised land but crashing instead against a wall of prejudice and racism - I believe the huge potential that this theme carried was not fully exploited. Levy's style of writing is very neat and with peaks of originality, not to mention her dry humor which infuses the pages but, I am afraid, that is as far as this book went for me. I found it long-winded and boring, especially the 'before' parts, and I found myself rushing throught them to find out what would happen in the present days. Truth to be told, nothing much happens and my perseverance in getting to the end of the book was not even rewarded by a great finale. Sorry to go against such a strong current of support, but this book did not do it for me, and I was relieved to turn the last page."
Very well rounded game with a lot of challenges,The game is excellent for the ones that like to set down every day/other day and play to the next save point. It gives challenges but it is long enough and challenging enough to not set down at one time and play the game.
Depends on your mood,"If the ""amateurish"" comment meant this was not solve-the-whodunit material, I agree -- it's good bedtime, or escapism, reading. I don't think it should be classified under either Mystery or Suspense.However -- the historical basis combined with modern elements made for an interesting plot. Some good characterization and steady unfolding of the storyline kept my attention until the end, and of course,""Life is too short to read a badly-written book."" ~ T.M."
Love this film!,"I loved this film in the theater and now I've shared it with friends who love it, too. Such a wonderful story situated smack dab in my youth when none of us knew how to get through and the grown-ups were no more adept than we were. And then there's the food. And Dusty Springfield. Wonderful."
"Blender - Great!, Food Processor - A real loser!","I've just thrown out the food processor part of this appliance and replaced it with one that actually processes food! Often when you buy a tool or appliance that has more than one function you get a compromise that does neither task well. In this case, the blender works great, just as my old HB blender did for 20 years. However, whoever designed the food processor attachment didn't test it out enough in the kitchen. The ends of mixing blades are a good half inch from the sides of the bowl, when mixing or chopping anything but pure liquids, all the food gets moved to the sides of the bowl and out of the way of the blades. I had to continually stop it and scrape the food back into the center only to have it spin to the sides unchopped again - totally useless! Also shredding cheese nearly brings the slice/shred blade to a stop. Just not enough power there."
The movie is okay...,"the movie was okay, but a part of me knows that this could have been a great movie, if it had a better script or a better director. But the cast was great. There didn't seem to be much on this DVD as far as the special features goes."
What crap! One of the worst horror films ever! such a rip-off!,"I cannot believe how crappy this low budget horror film is! This movie also is such a SUPER rip off of Friday the 13th, I think they should sue! I mean come on! ""Jason Voorhees""! ""Trevor Moorehouse""! The people who thought this one up were totally retarded! DER!!! The film was only about 23% enjoyable, and the gore was not that scary. The ending did not make sense and the there was a huge plot hole! I mean...what? This movie is not even a good rental. If you just want to see every horror movie that comes out might as well rent this and see how dumb it is."
The BEST Christmas Album since the Carpenters,"Well...These guys are just so darn talented it is hard for me to express in words. They not only do justice to the standards BUT add three NEW songs of their own. All three AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! Very visual songs...Makes me want to go out and buy a tree in May and get a cup of hot Chocolate and decorate. best album since ""The Carpenters"" A Christmas Portrait.Dewey and Gerry ...just keep writing and recording. And I'll stay happy!!!!!!!"
READ ALL ABOUT A MANIC,"The book MANIAC MAGEE WAS OK.Maniac was very adventures, likewhen he runs, it was like when he ran he would meet someonenew. Usally that person was the person that he became friends with orlived whith.I though maniac was loveing & careing. like whenmaniac lived with aunt Dot& uncle Daneven though they did nottalk,the beales even though they lived in the east.also he lived withthe McNabswhile they were bad and the pickwells even though there wereto many.i like that he did not care how bad or color you are. likewithmars bar, mcnabs ,and the beales. i like the ending it wasgood. ...that is why i though the book was ok."
SEE IF I CARE BY GARY ALLAN,"AWESOME!!! ALL SONGS ARE GREAT, ESPECIALLY THE THE ONE WITH WILLIE NELSON 'A SHOWMEN'S LIFE' AND'SONGS ABOUT RAIN'HE GETS BACK TO REAL COUNTRY MUSIC. TRY IT AND ENJOY!!!!"
Not quite the same as the previous versions,"I didn't like Generals as much as Red Alert and Red Alert 2. For me, it's all about building different kinds of units and structures, but the selection is about half of that of the RA games. But the best graphics to date if you can afford the 1.5 GB of space it takes up."
I love this device!,"I finally received my Line 6 FloorPOD plus, and i love it!... it's very good and give me amazing sound. The delays are very good, similar to the line6 independent delay pedals. It's a low price article, i highly recommend it."
"The Hits, an important part of Genesis career","After the departure of Gabriel and Hackett, Genesis' sound changed drastically, from the complex pieces of progressive rock to a more commercial-pop sound. Whatever the direction was, Genesis had success as both, a progressive band, and a pop rock band, and they showed that they can create good music, commercial and not commercial. This collection may lack some of the most brilliant pieces of the progressive era, such as ""Firth of fifth"" or ""The battle of Epping forest"", but it includes all of the band pop hits, which makes it the only album that casual fans may need, and a sampler of the pop era of Genesis for the progressive-Gabriel era fans."
Too Much of the Author,"The book is an interesting look into the lost and forgotten places of the New York Underground. There is a lot of history presented by the author which is interesting and insightful.However, after the book starts exploring the author's expeditions, it sort of becomes like watching a relative's slide show of their recent RV trip. The photographs become ""Here I am in [x aqueduct]"" and ""Here I am in [x tunnel]."" In other words, the book loses its focus on being informative, and rather focuses on the author herself."
Tricky to find thid one/,Have some favorite lounge chairs which took a beating with our Arizona summers. The lacing just crumbled and after some searching found the right replacement to replace the the rotted ones. It was an easy job and my chairs are now like new!!
Feathers were in bottom of box when it was received,The hat is nicely made except the feathers were not protected and are broken in half. Amazon does not allow for an exchange. Also the feather shown in the picture is not what is shipped with the hat. They are skinny and short. disappointing.
FAST BUT BAD JOB FOR PROTECTION THE ITEM,"Really desapointed for the pachage, bent and damage, the bottle of perfum cover of sticky finger print, Well not possible to offer in this CONDITION !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
There are plenty of better options out there,"There is much to be missed in the song titles and review here. This disk is a bit over the top, lyrically and musically. There are lots of religious overtones and references to God, which for better or for worse, is not mentioned in the description or reviews. There is an Enya-esque quality here without the professionalism. For this type of product, there are plenty of better choices."
Great power saver,"This power strip is excellent. It allows me to leave everything else on and when I turn off my computer, the monitor and speakers shut off automatically without me having to hit a power switch. That seems a bit lazy, but Windows computer take so long to shut down some times that I don't want to stand there and wait for it to shut down. This eliminates that need.Well worth it."
Cost,Why does it cost $300?? Please let this make sense to me. like shouldn't it make sense that it should not cost so high?
Myst URU,"I am a great fan of Myst and all its variants, but my operating system (Windows 7) does not support Myst URU, nor am I aware of any patches that will remedy the problem. Thus, I wish I had known about its limitations before I purchased it.MYST URU - COMPLETE CHRONICLES (JC)"
Bitterly Disappointed - Can't Find Anything in Office 2007,"Ouch. What a disappointment! I am an enthusiastic upgrader and never fail to upgrade, but this one was a mistake. MS took a proven, well-established user-friendly interface and decided to make it ""new"" and ""different."" Bad idea. It is new, different, difficult, frustrating and a definite step down from the last versions of Office (2003 and XP). Office 2007 runs fine, but with the new ""ribbon"" menu system, one cannot find anything and some previous features and options have seemingly disappeared altogether. The interface is user-hostile and you need to click on ""Help"" to find features, once obvious and well-presented. Save your money; you will be happier with the last version of Office."
Great Help,I really liked how this book was written. It made it easy to understand what it was explaining. It had many different examples of the many formulas so that I could understand the way to work out the formula. Great book.
Good starting point.,"I agree with some of the other reviewers. This book provides good jumping-off points for group discussions. But all of that info could fit into a few pages containing plain lists of topics. The worksheets are much too childish, even for my lower functioning patients."
Completely Horrible,"I fell asleep and woke up to this piece of cr*p on the television. Not only was it completely impossible to follow all the tangential story lines, the premise that this man who was a liar and a thief gets ""santa"" mind control powers and then still goes on deceiving and gambling is RIDICULOUS. The kids are like sesame-street wannabes but WORSE. The fact that is has Dabney Coleman in it playing the exact same dufus character that he always plays is just the tip of the xmas iceberg. I hate Tim Allen and would watch The Santa Clause five million more times than this movie. i've only given it one star because i couldn't give it none."
"Okay as a novelization, definitely not a real novel","This novelization of the TV miniseries works well for the purpose for which I wanted it: to keep my memory of the miniseries alive until I can buy it on DVD, and for use as a refresher course if there should be a TV continuation before then. It certainly has no great literary merit. There are no descriptive passages; since it was clearly written before casting, characters can't be decribed even as to race. That omission is so glaring as to be distracting. And on the last page, the story does not so much end as simply stop. The miniseries brought it to a better conclusion."
Unredeeming; implausible; unjustified,"I keep thinking I ought to like J. C. Oates's books. I keep buying them. I keep reading them. After this one, I'm going to quit.Unredeeming and unlikeable characters except for the rage-filled brother, the only one who sees what's happening.Implausible plot.Utterly unjustified, sugar-coated ending.Waaaaaaay too long. Oates needs an editor in the worst way, someone to tell her when to STOP.Dreadful...I'm over it."
Istambul (Eyewitness Travel Guides),I can not make my review by the simple reason that I did not received yet the book i've bought one month ago.RegardsRoberto Felicio Coimbra
Eh...,"This book was a bit typical for my liking. The setting was stereotypical only to be mixed in with bland characters, all told through a horribly punctuated journal of a tenth grader who seems like someone who should still be in middle school. Through this story Jeremy, our lead man, experiences the many things which high schoolers encounter. And what are these things? Why smoking, drinking, partying and sex of course! All told through immature eyes, making this book one which I did not enjoy very much..."
Just historical,"I see people usually like this book. It is remarkable how much history of philosophy Heisenberg knows, however I don't really find a thesis here. Not like the principle of complementarity of Bohr. He makes parallels and shows how August Conte was wrong in the way that he didn't proclaim that science evolved of changes in language.I does not go far from the standards from today."
Waste of Time,"Okay, someone writes a book to attempt to prove MacDonald innocent. The writer makes lots of money just as McGinnis did with the first book Fatal Vision(which by the way is more entertaining to read.) But the facts of the matter are that MacDonald's appeals have all been turned down and every bit of new evidence has been rejected by the courts. And now his attorneys are trying to get a new trial based on what they say was a threat to MacDonald from a prosecutor. Sounds like grabbing at straws to me. The courts decide and they have found him guilty. Of course there are people who will cling to their belief that he is innocent. But then there are people who believe that Scott Peterson is innocent too. But they're not the courts so it doesn't matter. Skip this book, it's boring and nothing new is spectacularly revealed."
Worked Great...Until it Didnt...,Stopped working 2 months after purchase date. Just didnt turn on anymore. Other people seem to have had this problem too. My verdict...don't buy.
It goes cold when needed most.,I got the handwarmer as a Christmas gift to help keep warm while fly fishing. Unfortunately it works great indoors but as soon as I'm outside it goes cold. I'm sure I've got it filled properly and that it's started. It's very warm before I put it in my pocket. But once I put it outside it just goes cold. As soon as I bring it indoors it starts to heat up again. It's a real bummer because it's a great idea if only it would work.
Where was the plot?,"I kept waiting for a plot to determine this was a mystery. You always knew what was happening so no suspense there. It just seemed like a written Hollywood chase scene to try and kill a couple of the characters. The idea of the super computer taken over by a human brain was very weak in my estimation. Probably wouldn't even have finished the book if a friend hadn't told me it was the best book he had ever read. Difference of tastes, I guess. Save your money for a good book."
Effective compression and relatively comfortable,"I bought these stockings because I'm a vet student in my 30s, so I'm on my feet for 12-16 hours a day on clinical rotations, and my husband and I are expecting our first child so I was worried about varicose veins.The stockings are more comfortable than some other pairs I've tried, and continue to stay up exactly where I put them on even after multiple wears and washes. They're not as effective at compression as some of the other brands I've tried, but my legs and feet still feel MUCH less tired at the end of the day when I wear them than when I just wear regular socks. They really make a distinct difference. And, I'm 6 months pregnant and so far (knock wood!) haven't gotten any bulging veins!"
Better than the Book,I thought that the information presented is better than the way it is presented in the book. It's a great tool for those already on the path of fulfillment.
"Good for those with time to waste, and money to loose.","I have read, and used Ted Warrens approach, and found some of the strategies useful. If you do not have access to the Bulletin Board quotes, and an active chart subscription, dont read this, also if you donot have access to real time quotes and dont want to watch your securities on at least a day to day basis, you may miss the chance to make it big....overall if you are a risk taker the book is for you. @ 75.00 it is a steep price, go with O'neils books from IBD(investor Buisness Daily)"
One word - POINTLESS,"""Boring"" would be another great word to describe this book and if you want to use a phrase, ""waste of money"" would seem to do it justice. If you want a book 700 pages long with absolutely no movement in plot this is your book. This picks up where book 9 ends and finishes where book 9 ends. I hope Robert Jordan cares enough about his fans to move things along in the next one. Of course I seriously doubt I will be running out to get it after reading Crossroads of Twilight and either will you."
You get what you pay for,"Don't fit THAT well in the ear, and sound is mediocre. Feel cheap but I guess it's what I paid for ($10). Would rather pay a little more for something nicer."
Watch it only for Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman.,"Weak minded and painfully inaccurate film about guns is a slap in the face of those who are trying to find a real solution to the problem. Its really easy to try to find a bad guy in all that has happen but in the real world, the complexity of the problem is more profound than good guys and bad guys and happy ending are hard to come by. Other than that, the script is really choppy in places and the director over stylizes certain scenes a little too much, forgetting the age-old rule of less is more. The acting is great with Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman stealing scenes left and right, making the movie a little better than it should have been but other than their strong talent, the movie suffers from a misguided purpose of self righteousness. A purpose mined you that are full with Hollywood fantasy.I rather see something with a little more reality to it than a fantasy film that leaves out the truth."
Unexpectedly Entertaining,"To be honest- when all my friends kept saying you HAVE to watch the walking dead.... I was like...Really?? How good can yet ANOTHER zombie show/movie be...never mind a long running series... OK... I was WRONG.... this show is great.... mainly because it isn't really about zombies.... that is just the background to set the stage for how all of the ""living"" interact and react to this apocalypse. Season 3 really starts to develop with two plot lines that eventually intersect...well more like CLASH. The turn over in cast (due to a high death rate) was originally annoying because key characters you liked would die, but new ""survivors"" were constantly introduced. Now you see that all the former cast ""deaths"" have really helped to shape the remaining core characters. I don't want to spoil any plot points here.Definitely suspenseful, intriguing, and makes you look forward to the next episode. Also definitely NOT just another zombie story."
Brass polish for a tarnished image of a Hollywood broker,"McGraw-Hill should be ashamed of itself publishing this ""puff"" piece designed to convince us that Mike Ovitz is not really Sammy Glick. The book, based upon pre-approved (by Ovitz) interviews of Ovitz's friends, relatives, clients and supporters, tries to convice us that Mr. Ovitz is a misuderstood humanist and intellectual merely hidden from view by the preditor disguise he must wear to survive in the Hollywood jungle.Rubbish!"
Great way to get introduced to OAR's non-radio play music,"My first OAR album, although I had heard their music with friends. Definitely recommend this one!"
Very Disappointing,I never understand why manufacturers of a great product have to change the design but that appears to be what happened with this dustpan. My daughter has one that she bought a few years ago and it works beautifully - there are never any small lines of dirt or dust left at the edge of the pan - but hers has a small rubber strip at the bottom of the pan and that must be the reason why hers works so well. I bought one this December because my cheaper dustpan always left that line of dirt but the newer version doesn't have that strip - and it does leave a line. So now this dustpan doesn't work much better than cheaper ones.
Easy light fun - makes you want to visit Montana,I rented this movie based on the box cover. Not really looking for a romance movie just a nice drama. I found as I watched the movie I became more and more interested in the lives of the three main characters. The writing is not Shakespeare but the movie flows and the actresses are easy to watch. I enjoyed the play between the actors and seeing Montana. Did not really need the extra plot drama of the murderer plus ex-husband - one would have been fine. Otherwise a fine drama with some fun acting. I recommend if you want something easy for an evening.
Terrible movie,Had several people recommend this movie. It is one of the worst movies I HAVE EVER SEEN. DON'T BUY IT. WASTE OF MONEY
Nice movie about New Zealand,"This is a nice movie in which one learns a lot about New Zealand culture. The protagonist is a likeable young girl and the Maori lady is a very interesting one. i found it under the Family film genre, and I'm not quite sure I'd put it under that category. While the protagonist is young there were a few of the more minor swear words in the movie, an underlying crush between the girl and her much older marching instructor, and a touch of idolatry in one scene. Admittedly, the film leaves one with a nice and pleasant feeling. But I'm not sure I'd watch it with impressionable youngsters."
Useless without headphones,"I have read the long as well as the short instructions, and can find no suggestions as to how to make the radio or recordings audible without putting on the enclosed headphones. Happy to receive corrections on this but I think almost anyone buying these would expect to be able to hear it play radio or play back speech through its own speaker, but no way to do this that I could find. Olympus has been in this business for long enough to avoid design errors like this; and the instructions are inadequate. But see my attributes reviews for credit where credit is due. Probably will return it, but hope for comments that rescue it!"
Now Really?,"What is the point of this book? Can the readers relate to the book? What is the idea we are selling? The nation was at war and they were exploring the human animal. The premise is not only stupid but a clear insult to intelligent people.I do not believe the writer developed the PROK character to suggest why he did have control of Milk's life. It also does not explain why PROK'S wife MAC went with it all.Some time, specially after 150 pages the book is pure rambling without any direction!!I am pretty disappionted with the book because of its lack of direction.Since I am not getting any good voteswhy not read the real book BY KINSEY?"
Good subject but...,"Sidney Reilly may be one of the most fascinating people of the 20th century, but this book bogs down in the tedious details. I understand that research demands things to be checked and confirmed so truth is uncovered. But a book demands to be read and that requires the reader to want to turn the page which I'm having trouble doing 100 pages in to it."
Shameful... never printed anything.,"I bought this printer with my laptop just over a year ago and I have never successfully printed anything. Unfortunately, I bought it while overseas and didn't even open it until the 1 year warranty had almost expired. I've plugged it in twice and, after several incredibly frustrating calls to the support line, have finally been told that the mechanism must not be working and I should buy a new printer... one month after the warranty expired. I was appalled by the customer service, or lack thereof, and will never again purchase an HP product for home use. If I could have given this product 0 stars, that would have been more accurate as 0 is exactly how many things I've been able to print. My recommendation would be to buy anything else... even a pen would be a more efficient printing method."
The best inflatable bed for kids ever!,"I own three of these beds. With eight grandchildren and one on the way, they are used often. In fact our four year-old grandson loves to spend the night with us just so he can sleep in 'his bed'. The slightly raised sides are a comfort to little ones and yet the length of this bed and it's strength make it usable for even our 8 and 9 year-olds. Can't say enough about how great they are!"
Do Not Buy If In 2012,Konica Minolta does not suppport there printers drivers when new operating systems come out. Why. It would take a tech guy a few hours or less to create a new driver. I have a perfectly low usage Magicolor 2300w and Windows 7 64 bits and Konica will not support Windows 7. I have heard this directly from them. Search the web and see how many people have this printer and others from this company with no current driver. I had to upgrade my Windows 7 to pro version so I could have access to Windows virtual XP just to operate this printer. Still having issues. I WOULD NEVER BUY ANOTHER KONICA MINOLTA Product. This makes my perfectly working 2300w a paper weight.Unfortunately this is a great printer that serves no use in 2012 unless your running XP or below.
average stuff,"For the price,..this stuff should do a better job of detangling and conditioning at the same time. I have a $3 bottle of detangler that does the same job. I had hoped this would be a whole lot better."
"No, no, no...Here we go again!","What is wrong with you guys?!?! These guys can't sing nor act! they are talentless! i mean they are just a bunch of FRESONAS (like those brainless popular girls we see in movies)! Is that the example we want to give to the younger ones? I really don't think so! So, why don't we buy something that can be a good example to the younger ones something that is worth listening and watching, not this kind of crap that is actually a copy of a argentinian soap opera. I mean, when are mexicans going to star and use their own original ideas and actually put some talent on the TV not just a huge butt and a pretty face but real talent?"
It is not what I expected. I consider it a huge waste of money and I regret buying it. I wont watch it more than once.,"I thought this video was going to be a great exercise video but it is not half as good as the one that I already have (Spin Sante) which gives you options for 30 minutes, and 60 minutes and is a great video for working out on your spinner. The accent was a bit annoying after awhile and difficult to understand. It was not a well-made video. I was expecting something that looked more professional and was more functional and motivating. I thought it was a bit boring in the end. I doubt my husband will watch it even once and I bought it for him as a gift."
Another boring King offering...,"The first third of Desperation is actually pretty good (that's why I gave it two stars). A crazy cop hunts down people and murders them. But then the ""bad cop"" disintegrates into the Tak monster and the book goes downhill from there. The story starts off in suspenseful realism, but King clumsily turns everything into a supernatual bloodbath. He tries to offer deep religious symbolism to the grand fight between good and evil, but I just didn't care.King's best days seem to be in rear-window. Dead Zone, Different Seasons, The Shining, and The Stand (bit too long, but good stuff) were superb works, but virtually everything King has written in the last 15 years pales to those early books."
Good,My grand-daughter really loves this. It keeps her happy and totally captivated while she sits in Pap-paps lap. Thank You
Could have been half as long,"The author does an OK job of tying the history of the world together using the subject of salt. However, he could have done it in half the words, and the connections are not very good. All and all, it was an OK book to read."
"Broke after 2 years, Dewalt said warranty did not apply","This tool worked fine for two years, then it broke. I sent it to Dewalt for repair, and they said that the three-year warranty only applies to defects in manufacturing/workmanship, and since this had broken due to normal use the warranty did not apply. So I'm left with a dead tool, for the trash can.Bottom line: don't expect this to last three years - Dewalt don't expect it to."
An interesting theory,"I read Ms. Willis' ""Doomsday Book"" and loved it. So I picked up ""Lincoln's Dreams"" hoping for the same experience. However, I was slightly disappointed. I thought it was a good book, but not nearly as well done as ""Doomsday.""Jeff and his employer, Mr. Broun, are working on a book about the Civil War, when Jeff meets Annie. Annie is having these horrible dreams and doesn't know what they are about. Since she thinks they may be about the Civil War, she goes to Mr. Broun and meets Jeff.The book is about Jeff & Annie's experiences in trying to figure out what the dreams are about, while Broun is obsessed with finding out what Lincoln's dreams signify. I thought the book was well written, and it was just the right length--not too long it was boring and not too short that a lot was left unexplained.If you really like Ms. Willis' books, you will probably enjoy this one."
How the mind plays tricks.,"I was so excited to rent this video and watch it with my son. I didn't remember it being so racist. I was incredibly saddened as we sat through it, hoping that my son wouldn't pick up on all the slurs against people of color. I agree with many other reviewers that this movie is a classic, it is just a shame that it was socially acceptable to make this kind of statement at that point in time."
Owned one for a few weeks,"There is much to learn about this camera so this is an early review. Absolutely delighted with results - well what do you expect from Leica lenses? My early outdoor shots were rather blue, read the manual, checked the white balance and changed from tungstan to outdoors - result great. The menu is really intuitive. So if the results are off, check your settings. Only 4 stars because I need to learn more and also check reliability but for now very pleased with this camera."
Insufficient Depth,"Any creative nonfiction writer seeking a how-to approach in this book will be disappointed. It is long on extracts from other published works with comments; however, is short on specific writing techniques. Overall, after reading the book, one gets a general feel of what creative nonfiction is, not the nuts and bolts of producing it."
Comfort,"They are very good and confortable for the price, I paid $70. It is very hard to go wrong with Clarks"
blast from the past,"A cheery story of a group of girls in a morally uplifting boarding school. Tells of a girl who needs to stay home for her health, and learns good lessons on love & friendship."
"Dusty, noisy, cumbersome","It seems like I've had to do maintenance on this vacuum prior to each use, as if housecleaning isn't work enough! Cleaning filters, unclogging the hose, reattaching the hose, etc... It's dusty and messy and has been since about the 3rd use. The only thing that's been consistent is the dust coming back out. It's too loud and messy and I'm kicking it to the curb next trash pickup. Wish me luck on my next attempt! Dirt Devils and Bissells are out for me."
My Review,"This is a story about two friends Margret and Elizabeth. They both come from two families and have two brothers at war. They have three enemies, which soon become good friends Gordy, Toad, and Doug. There is suspense when a crazy man is lurking the woods. There is disapointment in the town when a soldier has gone AWOL. But there is romance in the air where you least expect it."
not as good as expected,"I expected to hear something very romantic and stylish latino dance music. But it turned to be an ordinary clarinet with band. It has some latino rythem, but not very strong. It seems to me this is not a latino dance music. The player has some CD better than this one."
A Book only a bureaucrat could love.,"Book starts off interesting but focuses mostly on how the euro currency came to be, and etc, in minute details that isn't interpreted. Just a play by play of the bureacratic activity.I don't even know if I'm going to finish reading it."
Hydroxycut Hardcore,"It was shipped within the time frame given. I have lost weight and I noticed that the week when I was sick and couldnt make it to the gym I only lost about 3lbs but in the weeks I worked out I lost on average about 5-8lbs. So I highly recommend working out with this product and of course eating right! Also, when it says dont take it 6 hours before sleeping, DONT! I could not get a good nights rest when I would chance it. Overall, I would recommend the product for anyone who wants to lose weight and put effort into it by working out :)"
Hell No!,"This is not as good as Hell Yeah! I think that when you hear this the Geoff Kresge influence is being heard. It is watered down. I have heard that he wrote alot of this disc and I guess it shows. I have also read in interviews that they want to be known as a 'rock' band and not a 'psychobilly' band. Well, they pulled it off. If they want to try and get on the radio (and there is nothing wrong with that), this is the sound to go for. Best of luck to them, but this disc did not do much for me. Listen to hell yeah first."
Wonderfully written and teaches patience too,A very well written book which is appropriate for the upcoming Halloween season. It teaches patience through the story without making it at all preachy.
Great Improvements to a great Idea!,This is a must have for every homne. Great for grilling indoors for bad weather and eliminates stove top and broiler cooking too. We use it all the time and it a breeze to clean-up now.
CD of Rachmaninoff Piano concerto #2 in C minor;rhapsody on a theme of Paganini,I received this CD in a few days and have put it in my CD player in my car. Listen to it daily and smile in sheer calmness as the melodies flow. This one is superb.
"Interesting, if not wholly reasonable","I'm giving this film three stars because it held my interest from start to finish and because the ending had a very good twist. Like The Usual Suspects (which is a five star movie, as good as the classics, in line for best of its genre of all time), we get a wonderful twist at the end which completely changes the entire movie's meaning, back to the beginning. But this one isn't as compelling and doesn't stand up to intelligent analysis. Let's say you are a ghost, okay? Let's say you don't know it. Do you think maybe, just maybe, you would notice that nobody else sees you? There are ghosts in this movie, and at least one of them doesn't realize that people don't even see him or her. Hello? I have to hand it to Bruce Willis - he picks good scripts. It's not that he seems like the greatest actor of all time, but when you hear that he is in a movie, you know that it will be a movie with some quality."
Sorry if your taking a class that uses this one,This book is an incredibly hard read. The program that I took used this book and even the instructor said it sucked. Those of us already in the industry use much more complex methods and they are explained way more simply than this mass of words.
"Vomit, pure and simple.","The rantings of a sick demagogue turn out to be surprisngly fun to read, but in the same way is it's ""fun"" to see an overturned car on the freeway.Get a mop and clean it up; or it will leave your house in a huff- or , if you're lucky, in a minute and a huff."
The stresses of marriage,"This isn't the funniest romantic comedy, but it works pretty well as a movie. The movie features the rocky marriages of a divorce councilor and her parents'. The ups and downs in the marriages seem realistic and not overly Hollywoodized - something I appreciate as a married person myself. The plot even had a few original twists and turns. I for one was actually surprised by the ending, something I can't say about another romantic comedy I've ever seen. Overall, not bad."
Great Read!!,"I absolutely loved this story. This was an excellent light read, especially for the summer, when you just want to sit back, relax and take nothing seriously. Ms. Bond is a wonderful writer creating memorable characters. 5 stars."
Boring!,A whole lot of nothing happens in this film. Slower than a snail oozing across the grass its just as exciting to watch. It wasn't scary. It wasn't interesting. It wasn't anything but a waste of time.
MCSE Windows 2000 Certification Headstart,"This book lacked depth. It covers all the essentials but leaves big gaps. For example: in setting up sites, this books does not adequately cover subnets, nor how to add objects to the site."
Plesently pleased.,"This is a cross between crisp and sweet. It is nothing like White Diomonds at all! Its hard to give a description but it is sweet, not tart like white diamonds. Its a mellow sweet with a hint of crisp behind it. Its almost in the class of Paul Sebatians Casual if I have to give it a comparison to another scent. But don't exepct this scent to last as long as White Diamonds! Not even close! Plan on re-applying one to two hours again after first application because this scent does not go the distance. White flowers are like that and this is a white flower perfume all the way. Vetivers and moss's are the long distance runners in perfumes, not Muget's and Jonquels. This is a beautiful scent though! I recommend it to any age group and any time of day."
Verbose! Verbose! Verbose!,"The author uses too many fancy words in this book, may be to (over)compensate for the fact that she is not a native speaker of English. First half of the book is OK, but soon I realize she starts to flaunt/impose her own opinions and imaginations on her readers. The part about the Chinese girl is so far-fetched and behind the times. I stopped reading soon afterwards."
Missing workouts,I love these workouts but for some reason they are missing a few of the workouts. I would select the workout for arms and it would play for 5 seconds then move on to the next workout. Manufacture defect? I dunno!
drm killed another ea game,the drm and draconian limited install liscense ruined what potentially could have been a fun game.
skip it,"I would say this book should be checked out at the library and thumbed through. I would not suggest purchasing it. Time consuming recipes, hard to follow, disorganized... It's not worth the high price, especially for someone that is cashing in on vegetarian cooking and she's not even a vegetarian. Buy a cookbook from a vegetarian author."
Not worth the price.,"I have been using this water pick for the last two months, I consider it a piece of junk,It leaks terribly and no way to fix it."
for Boston and baseball fans,"This summer my husband took my 12-year-old to Boston for Red Sox/Yankee games at Fenway. This video was a must. We all thoroughly enjoyed it - my husband, a lifelong baseball fan, my daughter, who is beginning to follow in her father's footsteps, and me, a more casual fan. It contains the entire program of the original ""Curse of the Great Bambino"" with additional interviews added in after Boston won the World Series and broke the curse. Although big Boston fans probably won't learn anything new, the interviews, the despair of the long-suffering Boston fans and the history of the team are well-worth the watch. The same fans are interviewed after the Series. The interviews include discussions of The Curse with die-hard fans and baseball historians giving varied opinions on its existence. The entire documentary is a real treat for baseball fans, nostalgists and those who love the history of the game as a whole."
A Mom Buys it a Second Time It's That Good,"I am buying this book for a second time. We started the book when my son was 6, couldn't read yet, so I read it to him and helped him through the game. It was thorough, creative, and very humorous writing that I enjoyed using with my son. Now that my son is 7 and can read it for himself, he has used it so much that the book is in tatters. I think the book is very beautiful to look at, and indeed, worth having in newer condition, so I am buying it again. I would have given it 5 stars except for, like the other commentator, the swearing (I am, after all, a mom)."
On My Way To The TRASH!!!! BYRD CRAP GANG!,"WAT IS IT WITH JIM JONES THINKN HE CAN RAP? MAN FIRST OF ALL HIS LYRICS SOUND LIKE WILL SMITH IS HIS GHOST WRITER. AND """" CERTIFIED GANGSTA"""" ?? COME ON NOW WAT KINDA STUNT U TRYNA PULL WIT THIS. U KNOW AND I KNOW JIM JONES IS NO GANGSTA ! MAN THIS BYRD JUST SHH*TED ON HIS GANG!

HE STRAIGHT THE JIGGA OF THE SOUTH. AND LIKE I SAID DONT WASTE MONEY ON BYRD SHH*TTT! GO GET (THE CARTER) U GOTTA FEEL ME!!!!!!!!!!!"
And EP that's better than most LPs,"Isn't it sad that MGB's EP has songs that are better than almost every other band's LPs? It is just pathetic. I mean, tracks cut from some of their cds sound too good to be on most band's cds.This EP holds some of the best songs I have ever heard. Flashdance II is brilliant! Just a nice classic MGB rock song. The Fine Art Of Falling Apart did not quite grasp me at first listen, though after listening to it more, I can say that it is simply incredible! And... the best track on the cd, Flight Recorder... I cannot describe how beautiful this song is. I was just completely shocked the first time i heard it. And i still get in a trance every time i hear it. Very errie and slow, but it is just fantastic."
"Small, unknown things embody the essence of the large.","Roy's novel is earthy, fleshy. She reminds us that evil, particularly when it is focused on children, is international. We are forced, as westerners to recognize our world with all its flaws in the unfamiliar locus of India, and ourselves in the foreign men, women and children of Roy's book. Like the father who instructs his son in the Chandogya Upanishad, Roy's book takes the smallest of the small and instructs the reader that from this, one can perceive the finest essence of a thing."
Basic,"This book did not meet my expectations from an educational standpoint. I want facts and solutions, which this book did not offer. It was more of a personal journey. The author elluded several times about his sexual zest. The author also states in the book that he does not beleive in God, yet was a monk for several years. His spiritual aspects were never clearly stated. Which would have made a difference to me if I had known."
Touching Christmas Movie,"I watched this for the first time at O'Shea's (very recently in fact). In recent years, it has been a tradition for O'Shea's to play it for some of their patrons. Being a fairly new patron myself, it was fun to see some of the regulars and another friend of mine in the movie!The movie focuses on a small community, and their suffering parish. It is comical, yet it touches on themes that resonate in today's society.Shot right here on Cape Cod (on a shoestring budget it seems), and using local talent, I think this is a fun movie that brings out the Christmas Spirit in both the viewers and the actors on screen."
Beware the cult of Jill,"If you are considering buying this or any Jill Sobule album, by all means listen to an audio sample to see whether you can tolerate her affected, cloying school girl voice. It recalls the kids on Fame, or possibly Zoom. She should be singing with muppets. If you like your pop tempered any degree of grittiness, avoid Jill Sobule."
classic and underrated!,this a terrific album that i could have received a lot more pub. the music still sounds relevant today. highly recommended. great album from an underrated band!
Better than I predicted,"This book was slow to start for me. The characterization was a bit far fetched. But I did get into all the prison details once I got into the meat of the book. I was more interested in what was really going on with everyone. The hidden truth was held out almost to the end. I won't give it away. But it is worth getting through that slow beginning, the more satisfying heart of the book, and finally all the truths at the end. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because it just didn't qualify as a true page turner for me. I was entertained enough though. I wonder if prison life is really that intense... I was amused enough to finish and entertained enough to rate it a 4."
disappointing,"Had I read this book years ago, I would be raving about it. However, most of it detailed incidents that have been discussed, written about, and reported on ad nauseum. Otherwise, it was a good book. The writing was excellent."
"THANK GOODNESS, I COULD FIND A BIG SIZE !!!!","Its always hard to find size 26 Lee pants, looks like companies/stores would know that whey are always bought first. Really am glad that I can sign on and find a pair of pants to fit. Thanks. Lee are the very best !!!!"
Worst Of Mortician,"This is definitely Mortician's worst work. It comes packaged in a flimsy single case with a small Relapse Records catalog replacing any liner notes or lyrics.As for the music, this is a CD release of Mortician's first EP, with 17 (!) bonus tracks, culled from a demo and two live recordings. Considering that every song except for the title track is rerecorded on ""House By The Cemetery""; ""Hacked Up For Barbecue""; and ""Final Bloodbath Session"", there's not really much point to buying this release, unless you're curious as to what the band sounded like with live drums. Furthermore, the sound quality on this CD is absolutely atrocious. You won't be missing much if you pass this one up.For those of you who are curious, the movies sampled for this CD are ""Night Of The Living Dead (1968)""; ""The Shining""; and ""Phantasm II""."
Joanna Trollope Fails to write an intriguing novel,"This author was highly recommended to me by a friend with whom I share many similar reading tastes. Imagine my disappointment when I had to force myself to finish this book.The characters were not likeable and I could not care about them. Only Hillary evoked any sympathy from me. Gina and Sophy and Lawrence and Fergus all left me cold. I cannot imagine a group of more unlovable characters all assembled in one novel. How could anyone feel for the spoiled, self-centered, uncaring Gina? And how did she become this way? She certainly did not grow up pampered and her mother Vi seems to be a caring person. Lawrence came across as dim-witted and totally controlled by his feeling-of-the-day. Because I could not care about these characters, I could not care about the repercussions of their adulterous shenanigans and will not be inspired to read anything else by this author."
Gag,"Well, it lives up to its title, anyway. Typical '90s trash -- as if this decade needed more of it."
Broke after a week of usage.,"I inserted the replacement bulb and it was working great. I did a few shoots and a week later, it stopped working again. It's brand new!!! These bulbs are supposed to last forever."
Unusual Book on Missouri History,This book could be read over and over. The illustrations are unique. Anyone interested in the history of the Civil War in Missouri should have a copy.
Makes good pizzelles,This pizzelle maker is light years better than my 1940's model which had no heat regulator and was not non-stick. I still use a spritz of canola about every third batch and the pizzelle's are perfect.
ok,i bought it used... i didnt expect a new cd... but there was scratch on the cd... the game didnt start many times.. i gave up playing it
When it works - it's not bad...,"I use a spotlight on my ranch mainly during calving season, where you have to drive around in the fields checking the cows at all hours of the night.I have used these spotlights and you can get a decent amount of light out of them, but the trigger button has failed on all three of them that I have owned. After using this light for 3-4 months, the trigger would stop working. Granted, a spot light on my ranch gets somewhat abused in how I use them, they are hanging out the window of a truck in -10 weather, but that should not affect the trigger.3 million candle power is getting to be ""small"" these days. There are many other products out there well above 3 million.I have switched to this spotlight:Black and Decker 20 Million Power Series 3335 Lumens Spotlight #VEC192- they seem to have fixed the switch problem (it's a Vector light rebranded) - at least it has not failed on me after more usage than the Vector light listed here."
HDMI cable,I couldn't believe the cost. Approximately $3.00 no tax. Brandsmart has the same cable for $50.+ It works perfectly with my new HD tv (750 samsung). It arrived in 4 days. I highly recommend.
Godfather of Soul Collection Set,Disappointed in this collection set. All the songs in this collection set are performed and recorded in his later years and revised or/and digitally extended.
"Buy it, it is very nice but....","I love the concept of this item. I gave half to my daughter and she put it on a chain and it was so nice. The only thing I don't like is that I wish it were a little bigger or thicker, i.e. more substantial. I understand that the cost is less if it is thinner, but I would rather pay a little more for it to be a little bigger or thicker, since this is so beautiful and will last a long time. I would definitely recommend it in any case."
Not her best work,"I wish I could be more enthusiastic about this CD, but she seems to be working at it a little too much. Also, the energy seems lacking..."
Gwyneth and the Thief,"The plot was very well written and interesting, especially for people who enjoy reading romance or history novels. But, the plot was being built up far too much. The author got stuck in the middle, yet kept plowing on. The end was hasty compared to the rest of the book. Though I enjoyed the beginning, i thouroughly do not reccomend this book."
Sending it back,It is junk. cheap plastic. takes a very long time to charge and it starts charging about 5 mins after you plug it in. I dont think its worth the money. I can get something alot better in Radio Shack for the same price. way too expensive .
not work on macbook pro,"when i calibrated my mac book, it's quite okay, but looks a bit blue. i thought coz i'm too stuck in my previous screen color. Went to the system preference, wanna play with the Huey preference. It turned out Huey dosen't WORK in Intel-based MAC....what kind the program doesn't work on Intel-based MAC????"
You won't be able to put it down!,"After reading her husband Tom's kiss off letter, former beauty queen Miranda Smith discovers that he did more than desert her - he also drained their bank accounts, leaving her family owned company, Ballantyne Bras in financial ruin.She also learns that Tom had a penchant for wearing the company garb, when she discovers a revealing photo of him in lingerie, along with a well-manicured female hand.Miranda is forced to take over the company reigns to keep from going under, while trying to locate the cad. Telling the staff that he is on an extended buying trip, then trying to rebuild the business is her goal. But she does not count on Blake Summers, the sexy and suspicious Chief of Police being so interested in her plight.The plot will hook you from page one and the chemistry between the two leads (as well as the comical predicament of a macho father reluctant to let his tomboy daughter grow up) will keep you pasted until the last page."
"Good product, should have gotten sooner.","This is a great mobile, has lots of settings and the baby can turn it on and off. I waited till my son was 8 months old and I think that was too late. He likes it ok, but it doesn't help him sleep or be happy sitting in his crib alone."
guess that its typical to cling to memories you'll never get back again and to sort through old photographs of a summer,"Wow. Amazing.Best Tracks = ""Exaltation on a cool kitchen floor"" ""The awful sweetness of excaping sweat"" ""A celebration among completion""Buy it. Now."
wow,"this is a wallpaper seam roller. i bought a plastic one at lowes for 2 bucks. u can get a rubber one for 6 bucks at a hardware store. im sure this roller does work, but 13 bucks is crazy. i beat the heck out of my 2 dollar one and its still going."
Would have been a 5 if the discs worked,"Some of the discs just didnt work. They werent even recognized by the player. I tried a dvd player, a blu ray player, my XBOX, and a PC. All of which have played dvds or their respective discs fine any other time needed to. I dont know what kind of cut rate Chinese (as it said they were made in China) discs they are using, but they lost an easy sale from me with this one... Twice actually, because I bought a second one to try again, same problem. With the same discs as a matter of fact."
great for upper body,I am a little picky about my videos. i like a intense video for upper body. i found it here. cathe takes the band and puts it to good use. give it a try it is intense and invigorating. enjoy.
"311 keeps it real with the album ""Grassroots""","Track back 311 from success in mainstream rock to their beginnings in Omaha, NB and you'll find ""Grassroots"" This album has all the hip-hop beats, hard chords, and rap-rock good enough to shame Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock. If you're a 311 fan this is a must have album."
Not useful at all,It did connect but only once through my modem. Its a revolutionary product but I would prefer to wait for a better product in the market.
Not helpful at all!,"I bought this book on the advice of the previous recommendations-- Frankly, I really wonder what a two or one star book would look like! The book is positively DISMAL in its explanation of setting up and tuning Oracle databases. It seems as if it runs upon a dilemma: If you know enough to understand this book, you probably don't need it. If you don't know all that much about Oracle already, this book can't help you. The only thing it has that may be interesting is an index of SQL commands.I have had pretty good luck with other IDG books in the past, but this one is worse than if I were muddling along without it. At least then I would know was in the dark!"
DVD DEAL OF THE MONTH,"SO far this was one of my 1st purchase's and it was gift for my wife and this movie is in the Disney Vault so buying it at a lower price is like winning the lottery, I was expecting to get this dvd about now but it took only 4 days and was completely satisfied and could not ask for anything better I would DEFINITELY buy from this seller again!!!"
College Student Food,"this is one of the many ultimate college student foods. its easy to make, requires almost no external ingredients and comes with its own bowl so even if you live in a dorm you don't need any flatware."
Use Every Day!,"I bought this 'salt box' about a year ago and I absolutely love it! I keep coarse sea salt on one side and coarsely ground pepper on the other. I used this everyday in kitchen food prep & cooking. It's stylish, easy to fill and take a pinch out of even with my big hands. Each side holds approximately 3/4 cup. The lid swivels effortlessly. I love this so much I bought a couple more and gave them as gifts."
This book rocks!,"This book got my score from a 1420 to a 1510, and my verbal alone went up 70 points! the vocab section is particularly good, and the section on Guessing is unique for a this type of book, although helpful.. plus it's really funny! i highly recommend!"
Awful terrible product,"It uses a ton of batteries (6 C), which drain faster than you can put them in, and the company doesn't even have the decency to include the power adapter. That would be one thing -- if the product worked. But it doesn't. It broke after about two weeks, refusing to play CDs at all. Plus, the radio volume reset to zero every time it was turned off. The device was poorly designed, with controls that were very unintuitive. Having read the other reviews of this product, it's clear that this was more than just bad luck on our part. Do Not Buy This."
Good buy for the price,"I just wanted some decent ""in-ear"" headphones as the other headphones really hurt my ears. These are pretty comfortable. The sound quality is not as great as Bose or other expensive headphones, but it works for me."
Tight,Sound is good. The only thing which I don't like it's tight. May be it fits better for other people heads.
Good card,"I noticed how some people are saying they will ""never buy this brand again"" and that the brand is total crap. And yet the people that are actually unhappy with the card is less than 10, and the number of people happy with the card are about 45. Make me 46. I work at Best Buy, and we've never had people have problems with PNY memory cards and those that do, we happily exchange them out. You can't get a perfect product every time. Anything could mess up after a while.I have a Sandisk memory card in my old camera (about 2 1/2 years old), and my mom has the exact same size and brand in hers, and hers is the exact same camera as mine. The problem that she and i are coming across is that the Sandisk card is saying ""jpg incompatible"" with some of her photos and videos. My Sandisk memory card has started doing the same thing with mine. Does this mean i'll never buy a Sandisk memory card? Not necessarily. But i'm trying PNY for now in my new camera."
"great bagel knife, but be careful when using",this is a very sharp and durable knife but must be used with care as it could take a finger off if misused. but all in all most cooks should have one.
Should Be Required Reading in Every U.S. High School,"If people only knew the Eden that existed before the birth of our present generation, they might yet understand what it is we are currently taking away from future generations. This book changed my life - it changed my value system. It has a place forever on my bookshelf. How one reacts to the information contained in this book says everything about ones individual character. Not only is it a sad choronology of the death and destruction of life in North America, it is a terrifying indictment on the collective psychology of mankind."
Cute but tiny,"Very cute statue of a Bichon Frise, b ut small. The 8"" height is given. Guess I didn't think about just how small that would look out on the front yard! Again, it's the cutest one I've seen, but for the price I think it should be closer to real size of a Bichon, so passers by would have to wonder if it's real or not. THAT would be fun!"
Messages for children on Keys to Happiness,"I am a Psychotherapist and work with adults, families and children. A large part of my practice is working with parents on parenting skills and helping parents encourage children to follow values that lead to happiness and fulfillment. I recently came across Hans Wilhelm's new book, All For the Best: The Secret to Happiness. This book teaches children to accept things ""as the best"" without reacting emotionally to what goes on and to maintain balance and stay focused on what they are doing -- primary values to happiness. The whimsical illustrations awaken the senses and highten the enjoyment. It's an excellent book to promote conversation with children on how to accept what comes, maintain balance and remain focused with the end result of happiness. As a therapist and grandparent, I recommend this book to any parent or grandparent to share with their children and grandchildren a message on how to be happy."
We returned it!,We returned this Eton radio because it takes an unbelievable amount of cranking -- about 10 minutes per hour of use! Not a problem if you plan to use it plugged in or just for emergencies; but we've lived in a home with no electricity for 30+ years so this is an important feature. Eton was fine in handling the exchange/return of product/money. We now are happy with a Freeplay radio we ordered from amazon.com which plays several hours for much much less cranking than this one required per hour.
"OK, but a little cheap","This product works just fine and fits into my toyota echo like it was built for it. The fact that it is made out of plastic and has almost no way to actually attach the radio to the adapter without buying yet another accessory kit is why it only gets three stars. I was able to rig something up by drilling through the plastic and attaching screws, but c'mon that is a bit lame - charge a couple bucks more and give us the attachment hardware."
Good but twisted,"Lovecraft isn't really my sort of thing, but I thought I should at least read one of two of his stories to get some idea of his work. I happened to find this book cheap and read the title story and some of the short stories. At the Mountains of Madness seems to be considered his best. I have to admit, I enjoyed it more than I would have thought, as Lovecraft is a talented but twisted storyteller in a bizarre sort of way. Also, hearing about all these obscure gods with Sumerian and Babylonian sounding names (I guess they do come from their mythology) and finding about what they are about is sort of interesting, actually. Anyway, Lovecraft is a certainly a master of the macabre and the bizarre who can give you a pretty good scare for your money."
"Music From the Ukraine - soothing, meditative and cool!","Italian Guitarist, Flavio Cucchi is well-known in Europe for his guitar interpretations. He was born in Florence, and his wife Marta, who is an artist, does many of his CD jacket designs, although the CD title improperly says ""the Ukraine"" rather than ""Ukraine"", the difference being that ""the Ukraine"" refers to a province of Russia and the former Soviet Union and ""Ukraine"" signifies the inependent and free Ukraine and its cultural renaissance. Some of the praises about Mr. Cucchi: ""One of the best guitarists in Europe"" (CD Classica) ""...he is a musician of the highest order.He has an incredible facility for speed..he can also provide moments of intense, slow beauty and a passion..""(Classical Guitar) ""Flavio Cucchi, certainly one of the most brilliant interpreters in the panorama of the guitar in the last years"" (Strumenti e Musica) ""An extremely complete musician"" (les cahiers de la guitare) ""A true virtuoso"" (Ham & High)"
Lyin' like a fool,"This CD features songs that Elvis Presley recorded on March 31, 1972 (my fifth birthday!). This was a rehearsal for the King's upcoming tour. Normally, a rehearsal wouldn't be recorded, but this one was taped to have material for the documentaryElvis On Tour. As far as I recall, ""Separate Ways"" was the only song from the rehearsal to be included in the movie. This is Elvis and his touring group, minus the female singers and the orchestra. So, it kind of sounds like live recordings, but more stripped down and without an audience. The material is pretty much the same songs he did on tour, with the exception of an off the cuff version of ""Young and Beautiful"". As for ""El Paso"", don't get your hopes up. The band is tuning up, and what they are playing reminds Elvis of ""El Paso"", so he sings the first two lines of the song, and that's it. This is an enjoyable CD for Elvis fans."
One way to get sleep,"I had this with my daughter when she was born, that was 5 years ago and now we have another one on the way and I wouldn't go with any other monitor then this one. It's one way to guarantee sleep so your not getting up every 10 minutes to check to see if the baby is still breathing.I love it and recommend it to first time moms or moms who have 10 kids. It's a great product."
My 1 year old son loves this!,My 1 year old son is always singing and dancing with this thing. The microphone leads for hours of laughter for the entire family.
Pretty Good,"I know that Harry Potter is growing up and that the books cover an entire year, but it seems like he grew up an awful lot between the last book and this one. It was still a good book, but it's definately moved from older kid to young adult. There is less fantasy/adventure and more politics."
Love this item,I got this item after reading some of the other reviews while searching for the perfect ipod charger for my car. Belkin definitely makes some of the best products for ipods and would definitely recommend this item for anyone. Its a tad more expensive than other chargers but far worth it.
Disappointing,My son and I were very disappointed. I should have kept the old hit stix for him. They were way more fun than these. My son couldn't even play a tune on these like the Hit Stix. Save your money!
Commentaries often offer opinion as indisputable fact,"The book itself is very handsome and well put together. However, this bible is chocked full of commentaries, including many right in the text, which make it very difficult to read. Also, unless you have a very strict fundamentalist background (Pat Robertson is one of the authors of the commentaries) you will quickly become annoyed with the substance of these commentaries, because they present sometimes contorted interpretations of the text as indisputable fact. Only buy this book if you want someone else to do the thinking for you, instead of trying to read and learn the Word for yourself (which is a big mistake, in my opinion)."
The last reviewer was quite harsh,"I really enjoyed this book. Mr. Roberts wrote a wonderful story about his wife that he continues to love deeply. It is a beautiful love story! I believe that the author is grateful for the many years that he spent with his wife and I think that it is incredibly sweet and touching that he wrote a book about their lives together. As for the last reviewer, instead of ""flipping through"" the book while you were waiting for your prescription, you should have taken the time to read the book. Instead of taking the time to write a negative review based on the few pages you read, you could have used that time to read a beautiful love story."
Bored housewives best friend,"Could not put it down, will definitely keep you interested.Well written, HOT & STEAMY when is the sequel?"
Mario has grown and matured,"I luv the growth and maturity on this album. Mario is showing the world that he too can be romantic, loving, caring and sexual. This album is a must buy."
So Far So Good,"We've only had the product for a short time, so durability remains to be seen. Just my impression is that the construction might be a little lightweight, but we'll see. The performance so far is great! This thing sucked up things we didn't know existed in our carpet! We love the little power attachment, and it is very light so pushing is easy. Cleaning the filter is not a problem as we have seen some people complain about, we really don't know what their problems were, quite simple actually. We have recommended to friends already."
A Mighty Bag of Duh,"Just to prepare anyone who might accidentally watch this: roughly 50% of the dialogue consists of the word ""hurry"" or the phrase ""come on"", combined in all their possible permutations."
Great price for this product,I work in Assisted Living and these pads meet all the expectations of the best I've seen. They are a little stiff until washed a few times.
For very beginners only,"It is a beautiful book and a big book. However it is definitely for someone who has never scrapbooked and is just starting. I didn't get very inspired by the layouts that are a bit old school and I was already familiar with the techniques. If you're looking for a challenge, that's not the book for you, but if you are looking to get started with this fabulous hobby, definitely a complete book."
boring,"I don't know why this C.D sucks but it does.This series has by my reckoning 1 excellent session and by that I mean you should own .Marques Wyatts' disc is an absolute masterpiece of soulful funk groove for partys or just vacumming the floor to.Cotto on the other hand has no idea how to vary the sound and one waits in vain as on his dreadful 'Samba in the house' for something MUSICAL to happen. The endless drums just grind on aimlessly and we are left to wonder whether he has an ear for music at all.Davidson Ospina has written some incredible music, none of it is on this disc.Toca me la musica should be in everyones latin house collection and can be found on the Nascente release Revolution in the House"
Great visuals and concept,"I really liked this movie, mostly for the visuals and concepts. Kristen Stewart was surprisingly adequate, too. I have seen about an hour of the Twilight movies, and Kristen's inability, in those movies, to open her eyes or close her mouth seemed absent in this picture. Theron does a great job as the queen, as well."
Worth your time,This would be a great book to read with a book club or a couple friends. The content makes for great conversation. It is also written in a way that makes reading easy.
"Not great, but could have been worse...","The most original thing about The Blair Witch Project was that it appeared to actually be a real documentary. Well, this isn't the case in BW2. So you could expect that that the sequel lacking the most interesting aspect of the original film would be awful - but, actually, it isn't. I wouldn't say that it is an extraordinarily great movie, but it is good fun. I think that the only problem about it is that it has no real high point, lacking a furious showdown as it is typical for a horror movie. But this film is really okay."
I read it a few weeks ago,After a few weeks I can't really remember what it was exactly about. It was interested at the time but I didn't love it. I was just ok.
Cold war liberalism dusted off against a new enemy,"This collection of essays amounts to a ringing endorsement of George W. Bush's foreign policy or--alternatively--John Kerry's ""multilateral"" version of the same thing.None of them question the right of the USA to police the world. During the 1980s Berman backed the Nicaraguan contras. In the 1990s he defended NATO bombing in the Balkans. His latest crusade against Moslems angered at Western oil companies bleeding their countries dry is obviously to be expected.Todd Gitlin is well-known for his attacks on 1960s radicals who refused to back Hubert Humphrey for President. Such a proclivity for warmaking Democrats would lead one to question whether he truly understands the meaning of patriotism. Peace and noninterference are far more patriotic than flag-waving and war-whooping.Kanan Makiya is an Iraqi intellectual who was on the front lines urging war in Iraq. And so on.This book is not worth the paper it is written on."
Did not work for my dog,"The collar is built well, but it only holds less than 10 sprays. My 5 month old Pup would bark/shake her head and bark again until it was empty then just bark. I went through the entire bottle in a single day and it pretty much does not work.NOTE: YOU CANNOT RETURN THIS PRODUCT IF YOU BUY ON AMAZON!! So make sure you are ok with that. PetSmart won't do anything about it."
Buyer Beware of Product Features Description,"The description of the product and the title is confusing due to conflicting descriptions. It is not a Black Fibrox handle as indicated. Even though the title says plastic, product description says Fibrox and since most of Victorinox's knives comes with a Fibrox handle one would assume the sharpening steel's handle as well. Unfortunately it's cheap light weight plastic, hence the 4 star. I can spend less and get a cheap plastic handle with the same quality steel from other companies."
Great book!,I bought this book for my daughter who hated reading. By the 4th chapter she was hooked. My daughter is 12 and this is the first book she has read entirely. She loved the book so much she is now reading The Gypsy Game. This book is a real winner.
One of Allen's worst,UGH. Allen can do anything he wants and he has done genius work. Then there is this. Time travel as a plot device for self discovery? Romantic relationship nobody can possibly understand? Paris as a place to save it all? Sorry. Even Allen cannot get away with just about anything.
Did not work for me,"Well if I allow my small dogs to smell this, they run away from it, BUT when sprinkled around (half the bottle) around the areas where there are rat dropping and the top of the wall (in the attic) where the rats climb up, it does not appear to stop them at all......"
Great Bed,"I bought this when I first moved into my apartment, because I was waiting on my furniture.This is a GREAT bed. I am glad that I bought it.PROS:-never looses air overnight (I'm over 200 lbs).-Strong electric motor/fan. Inflates/deflates very quickly-very soft textured top, luxurious feel.-compact storage and storage case works well, stores nicely-Nice full size-ability to fine tune firmness very easily with remote (great length)CONS:- a little pricey but worth itThis blows all my previous mattresses out of the water. It's on a whole other level than regular superstore/camping blow up beds. I still use this matress for guests, who always say they got a GREAT NIGHTS SLEEP.I highly recommend this."
not the best mib,I have watched every MIB movie. This was a disappointment with the special effects. Not as many aliens as in the others. Its not a complete disappointment... But I would just rent this and not make the mistake I did with a purchase of the cd.
Good Service to Go Along with a Good Camera,"I have a feeling that if A. Rodriguez had to replace his camera after almost 2 months, it probably means that there was something with HIS camera not the actual model. I have this camera and it works perfectly fine and I have no complaints. When the flash loads, it takes at the most 5 seconds to do so (and just when you take the first picture after turning on your camera, not at any other time) and when taking a picture, it takes 2 seconds do so at the regular setting. Just tonight I had a ""problem"" with this camera and I went to HP's support and troubleshooting at www.hp.com and they, true to their word, replied in an hour and helped solve the ""problem"" which turned out to not be a problem at all. He told me how to fix it by changing the ISO Speed, White Balance, and EV Compensation and everything was how it was supposed to be. I definently recommend this camera."
Not the worst movie I've seen...,"But far, far, from the best.Definitely preferred cannonball run and such. Movie was full of bad acting, bad directing, and incredibly contrived scenes. There were a few laughs, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1, but the whole movie was just overall a painful experience... Find a better way to spend some money."
Awful,This was given to me as a gift. I believed it to be another hits collection. I found out that George Martin and son had fricked-up some of the greatest rock n roll music in the world. Why would anyone tamper with what was one of the greatest song writing teams and music groups that was the Beatles. If George Martin needs money I'll send him twenty bucks but please leave the classics alone.
defective cd,"I like Jann Klose's music, but the cds I ordered all have blips in them. I called about it and new ones were sent but they also have irregularities.This cd was recorded in 1999, I don't think that would have anything to do with it,but I wondered.My son bought a current cd and it is fine.Jane Boyer"
This book rocked!!,"I loved this book, and I thought Philip Pullman has a great mind. A lot of you think this book is satinous. What kind of world do we live in, so that we can't accept one another's feelings about God? I think anyone who thinks this book shouldn't be given to kids is dog-matic. Kids are their own people, and can't be told what books to read. On the brighter side, this book was one of the best ones I have ever read. I loved when Will found his father, and could almost feel how Serefina felt when she knew she had to kill the witch being tortured. DOES ANYONE KNOW THE TITLE OF THE NEXT BOOK? I have looked everywhere, and I can't find it!!!"
Was this book a Joke?,"This book, if it was meant to be serious, was without a doubt the biggest load of crap I have ever come across. Honestly, encouraging women to become addicted to speed in order to stay thin??? What is going on with the world?? I really hope that no young and impressionable girls read this and take it to be truth. On the other hand if this book was supposed to be a joke, then it is hilarious!"
Nothing I'd Use,"So there isn't much in this book I got any use of. The pictures were nice, but as a seasoned cook, who knows the basics of cooking, I didn't come away with inspiration for anything new with this book. Big Martha fan here, but not for this book."
Highly underrated movie,"This movie is fantastic and underrated in my opinion. The characters, especially Forest, really capture the spirit of American bootleggers during the early 20th century."
They killed Naruto!!,"Viz really did a horrible job translating Naruto. I had expected alot better from them, but they disappointed me. If you wanna see what they messed up on (detailed) and want to help in getting it changed, you should go here:http://www.petitiononline.com/ts000vc/petition.htmlit's really worthwhile for all the diehard Naruto fans outhere."
"Good, yes. Best animated feature, nope.","Happy feet started out strong, a penguin who doesn't fit in uses his special ability to overcome adversity. Nice plot line. Halfway into the film I was trying to understand how it beat out Cars - arguably Pixar's best effort yet - for best animated feature. Once I saw the environmentalist conclusion then I understood.Nice CGI, again not as good as Cars. Felt like it was longer than it needed to be."
Get Your Body Moving,"a delightfully insurgent work that reminds those of us who live in basic freedom what is so good about it.Taboo really dabbles in the realm of exploring your inherent right to use your body as you see fit (in gentle consensuality with chosen others). This is not for the NFL/Lonestar beer set that just wants to get their groove on. This work is for those who consider sex to be a highly sacred, enlightening experience worthy of the most assiduous effort and unbridled, maximum joy.Intelligence and ritual do play an intrinsic role in fits of ecstasy. This book deftly bridges the gap between ""Masters and Johnson clinical"" and ""in your face indulgence"" rendering a delightful and accessible (not to mention highly mystical) middle ground available to those with the proper focus and stamina.If anything, the book provides keys to becoming more sensitive to the finer nuances of human beings' favorite pastime.Enjoy!"
Best cover ever????,"I probably shouldn't write a review until I get the CD, which I'm ordering now. I heard ""High On A Mountain"" on our local community radio station this morning (KRCL, SLC, Utah) and it knocked my socks off... this may very well be the best cover of any song by any band! Not only was the delivery on the vocals excellent, but the fiddle really pulled it together.Then I saw the lineup... Matt Glaser, Andy Statman, Tony Trishka... it all made sense. I'm a fan of Jazz, Bluegrass, Folk, etc, so the other reviews discussing the mix of styles just intrigued me more. I can't wait to hear the rest!"
Satanic verses.,I have read a few of Bushdie books now and find him quite wordy but interesting. Can't understand all the Islamic uproar on this particular book.
"Truely a Black History Book (If you are Christian, please read this book)","This book is a must read for all people. Not only for people of African descent but for all.As an African American and a Christian, I must say that this book answers so many questions for me. Qhestions that I have had since childhood.After much searching, digging and asking, and after reading ""The Hebrew Heritage of Black Africa"" I now know beyond a doubt that we (African Americans)are the people of the book. (The Holy Bible). I could say alot more, but you must read this book for yourself and draw your own conclusions.""The Hebrew Heritage of Black Africa"" is well written, well researched, and easy to read. Please read this book. You will never be the same.""Know the truth and the truth shall make you free"" (John 8:32)"
Concerned First Time Mommy,"I recieved this activity center as a gift for my 4 month old son. I didn't have problems with paint chips however the pop-up doesn't really pop, it gets stuck all of the time. The other problem I see is the seat, my child's legs were rubbed raw after only sitting in it for about 15min. The other problem is he has hit his head on some of the plastic parts and has cut himself on the plastic book edges. I think this is a good toy for an older child but not for a 4 month old."
"Low quality fabric, should have returned","Quality is not what I was expecting from a Quicksilver product. The shirt was thin and cheap, makes a good shirt to work around the house in, just not something I would wear in public."
"Hole in toe of shoe, within a few days.","I loved Robeez for my baby when she was crawling, but now that she is learning to walk, I am not so sure that this is a good shoe for her. Within a few days after purchase, there was a big hole in the toe of her shoe. These shoes are pricey, which I am fine with as long as the quality matches the price. I may try buying one more pair, but if there is another hole, I will no longer recommend these shoes for a child when they start walking."
Jammed with the politics and poetry of the sixties,"This cd is everything you want in a specialized anthology. ""Where Have All The Flowers Gone"" is pure art and poetry. It takes you full circle and makes your heart sink. ""Eve Of Destruction"" is full of rage and insight and truth. It's atomic in its message and presentation. ""With God On Our Side"" is one of Dylan's best songs (best version is by Baez). Pure poetry again. And the whole cd goes on like that. Great sound. The somber ""Society's Child"" and the hauntingly barefoot on shards of glass ""Abraham, Martin And John"" slices you in two. ""Ball Of Confusion (That's What The World Is Today)"" is Motown exploding. ""War"" keeps the message movin'. ""Signs"" was always one of my favorite radio songs. This is a must for anyone who lived through the late sixties and early seventies and felt the rage and fear at the destruction and insanity from sea to sea. This collections serves as both great music and powerful inspiration. Buy it!"
Great start but got old quickly,"The premise of the book is excellent in that the history of the fighters should be preserved and we do need to document their stories but I think the book could have been written less as it was told, but more in the conventional manner in order to make it easier to read.The stories started to blend together after a while, as they were a few pages each, all written as the fighter told the author, so the book lost some interest to me as it went along.Perhaps more space to devoted to the old time fighters like Gunboat Smith and Willie Ritchie.I might even have done away with the whole section on the fighter who was saying that he was an assassin when he was young. If you know they are telling a fiction story, don't waste your time.The articles on fighters were a great read though. The author put a lot of work into it and should be commended."
Severe hive reaction,"I would caution you about taking this medication. My sixteen year old son is not highly allergic to products, but had a severe hive reaction after taking two tablets. I called the 800 number on the bottle and they instructed us to go to the emergency room since he had hives over most of his body. I'm not looking forward to getting the bill since I don't have insurance that will cover it. Even after giving him three medications while he was in the hospital, it still took four days for the hives to go away entirely."
Hard to get into,I am a big fan of Earth Final Conflict and I was looking forward to the book but I got a little bored with it. It seems to drag on in sections but its a good book. I recommend it if you are a fan of the series.
Piece of junk...,"I am fairly certain all the glowing reviews of this product are from employees or paid hacks. This thing is a piece of junk, I am curious how much TI pays college professors to force us to buy these difficult to read, poorly documented, over priced hunks of crap. The display is unreadable unless you have a huge light directly over the display even then it sucks, especially compared to the displays available in other small hand held devices, like my iTouch or cell phone. The quality of the documentation is so convoluted and cryptic that it is all but unusable. Don't waste your money on this if you can get away with using a laptop and excel or other software."
"BEST OF THE BEST EPISODES , ""WOW""","This episode was great. I cannot believe that poor Jenna is dead. I felt sympathy for John, who was a jerk, but turned out to be really good guy. Damon is dying from the wolf bite. Each episode just keep getting better and better. Again ""WOW""."
Good and Bad,"Very interesting book with an extreme prejudice against everything related to the United States and especially Americans. In fact had that been eliminated I would have given this a five star rating. If you can see past this major flaw I would definitely recommend the book to everyone looking to learn about the first Nuremberg trial, how it all came about, what went into having it, difficulties with conducting the trial, the trial itself, and the outcome. I did have to write myself a cheat sheet with the names, positions, and crimes of the defendants which can be easily found in the back of the book. In fact if you do choose this book I suggest you look at the back first to get a good overview of the charges and defendants, it will add greatly to your understanding."
Works well for one season then dies,Two years ago I bought one of these units. It worked great for one season. The next winter I followed the setup instructions and started up the unit. The unit heated up for about a minute then gave me the the dreaded two light error. The unit had died. I called Holmes and was told that the problem could not be fixed.Last winter I went out and bought another unit. It worked well throughout the winter season. At the end of the season I followed the cleaning / storage instructions and put it away.This morning I setup the humidifier and got the dreaded two light error again. One bad unit is a freak. Two units produced in different years is a more serious problem.Don't buy this unit if you want more than 1 year of use out of it.
Back to the Future,"Now I will start off by saying that I agree with Cameron that the series should have ended with T2. I didn't and we have T3: RISE OF THE MACHINES and the immortal line ""Talk to the hand."" TERMINATOR: SALVATION makes a better fit in that it takes us onward in time instead of having endless Terminators come back in time to save/kill John Connor. It has a serviceable performance by Bale as John Connor. Moon Bloodgood and Sam Worthington (actually a contender for James Bond) are worth the price of admission. The CG Arnie (the head on the body of Roland Kickenger -- who is not going to be Conan) looks fake. A popcorn film and nothing more. If you are looking for TERIMATOR or T2 you will be disappointed."
doesn't work on bare floors,"i did my research and read a lot of good reviews for this vacuum. i really wanted to like it, especially for the price, but it doesn't work on bare floors.i don't have carpet but wanted a good affordable vacuum for the floors and upholstery. i really needed the vacuum to be able to pick up fine particles and sadly, fleas - i'm waging a war on fleas even though my cat stays indoors. it's extremely hot and humid here and fleas just thrive. part of the flea treatment was to sprinkle salt on the floor and vacuum it up. the vacuum didn't pick it up, and just spread it around at high velocity - i could feel the particles hitting my feet and ankles. very disappointing.it seems to work pretty well on upholstery, though to pick up pet hair, you need to use the 'duster' brush and not the upholstery attachment."
Not what expected,"I thought that these gloves will handle well working with gasoline, but wasn't that way. Specifications did not say that will not resist gasoline, it is written in the box of the product (which you cannot see until you have it in your hands).They don't resist puncture well either after working with them for a while."
Startling.,"This story is startling. It does what Allen Say sets out todo, it alters you. No one writes about this stuff - age-ism -especially not in a children's book and through the powerful medium ofa hallucinatory/fantastic story sequence. It's definitely different and I almost want to say subversive. I wonder what children would think of it."
Game is fun but the copy protection renders it unplayable,"After getting addicted to Civilization Revolution on my iPhone, I decided to get the real Civ for my netbook. The price was right for Civ3 and it required less horsepower than Civ4, so I went for it. I had to use an external CD/DVDROM drive for my Asus to install it under WinXP.At first, all was great because I still had the CD-ROM drive attached. But then when I removed it to go for a trip, Civ3 suddenly stopped working. Turns out you need the original disk installed in your CD/DVD-ROM drive in order for the game to work.This makes Civ3 utterly useless for the netbook crowd since our drives aren't built in and many of us don't carry it along. Bummer.Great game. Lousy copy protection."
"Easy read, old info","This book is a great read. I found it warn and friendly. If you are new to Ubuntu and do not like tech books, this is for you. One thing though, it was out dated when I got it new. Ubuntu comes out every 6 months, so this book will always be behind unless the author starts using the beta to write the book, which would be the best idea. I would also have liked to see more on Kubunu, Edubuntu and Xubuntu as well. They are all part of the official Ubuntu family and one may have worked better of me as a reader."
White Clutter,"I am beginning to wonder if the babyboomer generation has equated pith and slick irony as intelligence. White Noise is a book austensibly about death, the meaning of life and the frivolousness of consumerism.Mr. DeLillo has created a small world where moderately interesting people take great pains to be clever, bathed in non-sequitors and absorbed in seemingly silly arguments. I will say, however, for every 5 ridiculous conversations played out, there is one that contains the germ of an interesting thought or concept. When Jack and Murray have a discussion about death, rage, meaning and the reaching of conclusions based on honest reflection, the insight and complexity of the books' intent come to the fore.I wish there was more depth, less faux tongue-in-cheek patter in this work."
liked the movie,I really like this movie. I watched it when I was younger and I still like it today. Thank you.
Knowledge Is Key.,Excellent for understanding the process. Especially when you are coming from a telecine film background. It has helped me immensely.
An Enjoyable Music Experience,"John Williams is one of the greatest composers of the 20-21 centuries. His music will live on for a long-long time. This disc provides the listener with a fantastic listening experience: Star Wars, Schindler's List, Superman (The Movie - my favorite on the disc), Jurassic Park are all here. There are some other lessor known gems on the disc: Sabrina, Stanley and Iris, Presumed Innocent and others. A very nice package! All of the scores are superb and well presented here. I enjoyed this cd very much and will revisit it again and again."
"Great seat, inexcusable base","The Pearl base is cheaply made despite it appearing to be heavy-duty, is the opposite of road worthy. When I first got it, I was impressed with the qiuck release height adjustment and bought one for a club I play at regularly. Granted, this club presents 2 bands a night 7 days a week, but the Pearl base was destroyed within a couple of weeks. Not just the tightening hardware, but the base itself was completely falling apart. The seat is still in great shape and is still being used at the club with a generic brand simple design heavy-duty throne base..."
Take a pass on this one,"This author is fairly arrogant for someone who can't write in complete sentences. Also, the principles espoused in the book can be found in any Business or Marketing 101 text book. And they don't contain near the amount of meglomania that this one does. Skip it."
Not a bad book,"This was a pretty good book. I enjoyed the story line and the characters. The leading man in this story is a bit over-the-top-caveman, but if you can overlook that, then you're probably not going to hate this book."
"Once I tried it, I was hooked.","I had my doubts about a single cup system. But once I tried it, I was hooked. The unit is easy to use, clean, and quickly brews a cup of coffee. There is a large variety of coffee flavors to go with it. And there is an insert that comes with it so our own bulk coffee can be used. We told our best friends about it and they now enjoy their machine too."
great value,"this dvd player can play DivX, Avi, Wma formats, and so on.if you want to watch those files on tv, this is the right one.however, if you have new 2007 formats, sometime it can't read."
Great headphones - awesome warranty.,Had these for a couple years and then the left earphone came apart. Mailed it in to koss and they sent a brand new replacement. Great customer service.
Incomplete CD,"This was originally a double vinyl album, and the CD is missing some of the best Poet-period stuff that was on the original. To answer an earlier question, it was recorded at the Hackney Empire in London - a wonderful old-school music hall and very atmospheric, as can be heard here. I love it but just wish that all the original tracks had been included. Maybe the complete version will go on sale as a download at some stage."
Reason for CD title,"He titled the CD as a goof ... remember Frampton Comes Alive and Cheap Trick's at Budokan.... Hiatt was just playing on words..... and all the shows he played at the State Theatre in Portland, ME were great....I worked them all and enjoyed every one."
"Great, little random at times",Season 3 is Not as great as the first two seasons. A little random at times. I wished they sticked the story more.
Not looking forward to the next one,"In the liner notes to KOJAK VARIETY, EC mentions that he considers this CD the first volume in a series. My question is ""Why?"" This mixed bag of R&B, ballads and the occasional well-known classic (Ray Davies ""Days"") is unsatisfying to say the least. Actually the liner notes are the best part, insightful looks at Costello's past and how his taste in music developed. The problem is I don't understand why Costello needed to make this record. Better he had put his name on a compilation of original recordings and let the listener in on what motivated him to create CD's like GET HAPPY. As it stands this CD is just a mistake. Costello's take on the various tunes lack the vitality of his original work and even the songs he should make his own, like Randy Newman's ""I've Been Wrong Before"" and ""Days"" are more annoying than memorable. If KOJAK VARIETY Vol. 2 does appear as promised, I think I'll skip it."
Fast delivery!,"Very fast delivery. Thebook had a little more highlighting than expected, but everything was in good condition."
Really Comfortable strap!,"Really comfortable strap for the price. It is padded and durable. Makes for a great guitar/ bass guitar strap. Once you get a padded leather strap, you won't want to use fabric or nylon ones ever again!"
Good for Just Basics,"This book is fine if all you want to do is basic spreadsheets. If cutting, pasting, basic formatting, or creating VERY simple formulas is all you need to do then this book is fine. However, if you are trying to do anything more complicated forget using this book. For instance, the section on creating Macros wasn't very detailed. In addition, the book is completely missing any explanation of how to use the more complicated formula functions (there is no mention of how to do any of the statistical functions). Probably 80% of what an average user needs is in this book. But for anything beyond the basics, forget it; you'll need another reference."
Disappointed with this box of bars,"The concept is good. I love the plain/original Oskri coconut bars. They have a nice texture. I like Mounds and wanted a slightly healthier version. These could be that, but this box was way below quality. It seems like it is old because most of the bars I have tried have discolored chocolate and the coconut is dried out. One of the bars even had a bad seal so that I didn't even have to rip it open and it was completely dried out. The plain bars are not dry at all, so these really did not meet the standards I was expecting. Won't buy these again, but that is probably best because the sugar content is high, even though it is superior to corn syrup."
Comparison with Razor Scooter,"My 12-year old son, who's ridden a Razor scooter since he was four, wanted the Fuzion for Hanukah. While it's a decent scooter, he's been disappointed at how clunky and slow it is, relative to his Razor. With four wheels rather than two, and a correspondingly wider wheel base, it takes some getting used to, as one tends to hit the rear wheels when one kicks to propel it, generally falling in the process. It's probably a nice scooter for someone starting out, or someone who's mainly interested in skateboard type tricks, but it's not a great scooter for flat-out speed or transportation. I wouldn't advise it for someone who's ridden a Razor or other two-wheeled scooter previously."
Not up to par...,"For $26 (that includes taxes and shipping) this is a pretty decent pair of camo capris for anyone whos looking for something to wear on lazy days lounging around the house and doing chores, or maybe even for a Halloween costume. However, the material is much too thin and delicate for long-term wear. Also, I followed the size chart according to my measurements and ordered a size 7/8 - it was more like a size 4. So if you're planning on ordering these make sure to order two sizes up from what you would normally wear. The size chart is totally off. I'm returning these and spending an extra $20 for a more comfortable and durable pair of camo shorts elsewhere. The shipping was pretty fast and the customer service was great, but these just weren't what I was looking for."
Great replacements,"These are 2 1/8"" x 1 3/4"" (unstretched) oval pads. With a little effort they fit my 2 3/8"" x 2"" oval Phillips headphones nicely. They are thinner than the original pads. As the package contained four replacement pads, I wound up using all four, putting a pad over a pad. The second pad actually went on even easier as it would not spring back when stretched because it adhered to the pad below. These pads were very inexpensive and I do not consider it wasteful to have used all four. They have brought new life into my favorite headphones which are now more comfortable than when they were new. Recommended."
Lace me up!,"This was written in the style of a ""diary,"" but was far more readable than the Bridget Jones series. This is probably because the Jones series was written with a lot of abbreviations and shorthand, whereas this book was written in a first-person narrative style. It was well written and humorous, and while I did really like the main character, there were some character features that I just didn't think... gelled. Case in point: she's very self-conscious about her weight, and yet, in bed she's a really wild woman. I just couldn't really see that, I guess. But the story was lively and entertaining, and I kept reading - in one sitting - so I'd recommend it to anyone who likes romance and wouldn't be offended by a little gratuitous... you know."
Expressive and Receptive Fingerspelling for Hearing Adults,"I was told by a native ASL speaker that this was not a good book but having said that, I found this book a guide for practicing. It has you fingerspelling whole sentences and I didn't like that but the parts where it has you practice lists of words with like letters was helpful. It didn't help in either expressing or receiving but it did help in just practicing the letters"
For older kids,It was a little scary so maybe not good for children under 7 or 8. Took a minute to get used to the claymation but good story. Some inappropriate inuendos not suitable for children.
On the wrong heap,"Being a complete stranger to Dean Koontz oevre, I was thoroughly misled by recommendations of other readers. Placing this author anywhere near the likes of Stephen King is doing a bit of a disservice to people with a minimum of taste. I don't want to get into the kind of hidden agenda and personal hang-ups that seem to motivate this writer, as they are really his problem, but they concoct a story that never once manages to create even a hint of credibility or interest. Some of the worst fears of Puritan and Paranoid America are being fed here & to the members of his parish this might well be entertaining; is there no way to seperate these kind of authors from the serious writers?"
Stay away from Jack-O!,"Jack-O is doubtlessly one of the most ridiculous horror movies I've ever seen. It's so bad it's insulting.The effects are so ridiculous you don't know if to laugh or to cry; the so-called actors should get another job (even Linnea Quigley is disappointing), and the dialogues are as low as they can get. I like cheap little horror movies if they can at least deliver some thrills, but Jack-O is just a waste of time from the beginning to the end. But what is really detestable is that they put in some material featuring John Carradine who died years before Jack-O was made, and then use another guy for the wide shots. How stupid do those guys think the audience is? Next time producer Fred Olen Ray (Beverly Hills Vamp) should direct himself, and not the obviously untalented Steve Latshaw. I'd recommend every horror fan to stay away from this waste of celluloid."
What?,"I was waiting for a finale that could tie this all together, but ended up stumped. I re-read the details and still have difficulty identifying who the bride is who received the timepiece... her father's the one giving it to her... and yet it is the daughter of the arsonist who comes to the house... oh, I was following along well until the last chapter, there.But, I didn't think it was worth a re-read of the whole book to try to figure out the twist. Were some pages missing from my copy?!?I usually like a good relational novel. This was a sappy novelette.Nicholas Sparks' The Notebook was a better hit."
Not Forever. Cracked & leaking in less than 2 months.,"Not Forever. I have used the pitcher almost daily for iced tea since the first of June. It has gradually been developing fissures inside the polycarbonate and yesterday I discovered a leaking 1"" vertical crack along the bottom edge after taking it from the dishwasher. It was never dropped & hasn't received any type of impact."
Great product at a good price,"Used in professional audio equipment (mixer, wireless etc). Reliable, good life in high drain devices. You can store them for long periods of time without any real loss.Little plastic caps to protect the battery leads are great for identifying new/used batteries in my kits."
CORRECTING AN ERROR,"Hello,I made an error concerning my reveiw of the book. I said that this book proves that Jesus didn't have a virgin birth and that Joseph was the biological father. That's an error. Sorry for the inconvenience.Thank you."
Deep Forest tryout by Dan Lacksman,"This CD can be called ""Neither here nor there"". Dan Lacksman's only connection with Deep Forest is that he was a producer for the debut album. Please don't mistake him as a composer of Deep Forest. This CD sounds like Deep Forest but not having the creative value what Deep Forest has."
Terrible in every way,"While new star Helena Mattsson will most likely take your breath away, there is absolutely nothing else in ""Species: The Awakening"" to keep your interest for more than five minutes. As a big fan of the original Species and to a lesser degree its first sequel, it's painful to watch these straight to video sequels turn the series in to straight up sci-fi cheese. Every trace of intelligence the series once had has been flushed away with the past two ""films"". ""Species: The Awakening"" is simply a boring, poorly acted, poorly scripted piece of garbage with terrible ""rubber suit"" special effects and laughably bad dialog. Even beautiful women like the aforementioned Helena Mattson can no longer save this series from imploding on itself. Sil would be turning over in her grave....."
My Losing Season: A Memoir,"Pat Conroy is our finest wordsmith. My Losing Season made me laugh and then made me cry. By the end of his time at The Citadel, I was laughing again. He weaves a story like no other."
Very small,This book is incredibly small. Quite a let down when I received it. Think twice before buying this book .
Hack of all Hacks,"The author of Radical Honesty is a complete Hack. His credentials rate as sewage water amongst those in therapy, psychology, and psychiatry vocations. He belongs to the school of thought that the more you tear someone down the closer you are to building them up. Does this make sense to you? He suggests that this 'radical honesty' improves relationships but he, himself, has been married several times. If this book doesn't send a relationship on the fritz, nothing else will. Skip this book unless you're a fan of quacks."
The story continues to unfold.,"The characters are pretty much the same, Five years have passed.The story continues to unfold and am looking forward to see whatJess has discovered and how this plays into the overall story."
Terrible,"every single aspect of this movie was an embarrassment to the original muppet showterrible pace extremly rushed ending ""so cliche its not even funny"", the worst jokes ive ever heard in my life sing a longs that last for way to long characters with no like value what so ever!!!!!!!!!!!"
Nice Workout,"The workout is nice and a bit challenging, but I agree with other reviewers that Jillian doesn't break down the proper yoga poses and stances, and moves kinda fast between moves/poses. I still broke a sweat, but I tried my best to use correct posture and go at my own pace."
I could have saved time looking on an online wiki,This book is the basic of the basic. It was filled with lots of breathing exercises and how to's on choosing a crystal ball. At about chapter 7 was when they had a how to section and this was only about a page or two long. I could have saved time just reading this stuff on the web. I was a little disapointed and was hoping for a bit more in the how to part.
Worked well for me,I thought this was convenient and easy to use. Seemed to give a pretty accurate reading.
Worth the Money!,"Definitely worth the money. I take it twice a day: immediately after workouts and 6-8 hours later like the suggested serving calls for. Felt results in a bout a week, bigger & stronger muscles and a little more endurance."
ENLIGHTENING!!!!,Craig's book helped me to look deeper into myself as a Christian and made me realize just how much closer I can be with my Lord and Savior! He put so many things into a new perspective for me! He truely has a God given gift to keep people interested while all the while bringing them closer to God. His comedic abilities keep this book light enough to keep you wanting to read more and more! I was actually sad when the book ended. I could've read more and more! I can't wait to be enlightened by his next book!
Very pleased,"I bought this collar for my 6 pound Yorkie-poo because of his excessive barking. I was a little concerned at first, because he's so tiny. However, this collar is perfectly safe and it works very well. I've had this collar for about two months now and I've only had to use the shock option two or three times (at level one). He responds very well to the beep option alone. Not to mention, after only a week of using the collar, his barking decreased quite a bit - even while not wearing the collar. I am very pleased with this collar and would definitely recommend it to others."
unfortunate indicator,"Phish has gradually devolved from a highly experimental, fusion-style band of creative virtuosos into a standard R&B jam band. Possibly attracting more fans this way, as well as reconstituting the mellow Dead feel, they seem successful. But I miss Trey's pushing the envelope so far that your head almost bursts and then a melody so sweet and beautiful issues forth that you swear Beethoven's been reborn as a guitarist. A word of fan advice to Trey: take back your lead! The old-time fans miss you!"
Interesting lil book,This is a much smaller book than I expected.(more like a phamphlet really) Which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Still I found it an interesting easy read.
Probably a commercial trick,"This book is at a slightly higher level than ""Probability Models"" by the same author but is not self-contained, and even if you have a fairly good level of Maths and Stats you will probably need both books to grasp the concepts adequately.Its cost is outrageous, yet it shows again Ross's strengths: good examples and a mix of medium-level and some difficult problems worth trying.The only problem is if you buy both books you will spend a nice sum for having 80% of the information repeated..."
Finicky,"I'm not sure if i just don't know how to use this, but I sometimes have to point it at certain parts of the camera for it to trigger the shutter. It would have been better if it triggered from any where otherwise I may as well use a cord. Other than that it works."
Hammock chair,"It arrived fast enough, but I should have sent the chair back. It's pretty cheaply made, the ends are taped with what looks like regular scotch tape. It's OK, but I'll keep my eyes open for a better one. And we won't swing on it. I don't think it would take it."
Nice read,"This is an old book but a very interesting read, well written by the slave authour unknown, possibly more educated than we are led to believe. A most enjoyable book of the days of southern American slavery."
Mio C520 Hard to See - Many Features,"The first C520 I purchased had a power supply problem (probably with the DC cord) and failed within a few hours of use. The replacement has not exhibited any of those problems.I purchased the Mio because of it's larger screen size and lower cost. Many skins are available online, so you're not stuck with the format the manufacturer devised. I've tried several of these skins, but none give a bigger view of roads and locations like the Garmins and Magellans. With my 61 year old eyes, I'm beginning to think a GPS with less features and larger graphics is the way to go. My other GPSs are IWays. I particularly like the IWay 550 - a very large and bright screen (it does overheat at times, though).If you like to tinker with your GPS, the Mio C520 is for you."
"Pretty, but boring","THis is a short film that is a typical school movie from the 1960's in style. Basically, it just shows the pond and uses a few quotes from the book."
I Tried,At the price I really hoped they would be good. I even tried charging them up several times they just wouldn't hold a charge longer than 5 minutes.
HEAVY DUTY MONSTER ROCK!,"Unpretentious,Heavy,Full of cool riffs.Yes,Grand Magus does it again.As good as the self- titled Grand Magus.100% better than any so called new rock bands.Shades of Black Sabbath,yes,but these cats have theyre own style.Im glad theres still bands who havent forgotten what it means to rock.Buy this CD.Thanks for your consideration.Stomp"
Thoroughly enjoyable!,"Paul Hecht's reading of ""The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs"" is enormously entertaining. For days I could not listen to a German accent without smiling :-)The book is short, but deliciously comic. McCall Smith's pedantic but very likable protagonists find themselves in all kinds of existential crises. Their very human struggles, set within the minutiae of of day-to-day life, will resonate with anyone who has ever had a benign but annoying co-worker, a seemingly harmless social misunderstanding. The existential crises of modern life, it seems, comes not in overwhelming tidal waves but in small everyday challenges. Nothing dramatic ever happens, yet each moment is filled with drama. Bravo, McCall Smith - well done!"
"Good info, dry speaker","I agree that there is a lot of good information provided in this DVD. Unfortunately, the speaker is not very dynamic at all. In fact, you can watch his eyes go back and forth as he reads the tele-type machine or whatever he is reading from.Again, it is good info but if you are looking for something that will really engage an audience, in my opinion this isn't it. (I'm still searching!)"
Product arrived nonfuncional.,I have no idea how this product works. It arrived at my house nonfunctional. A little quality control would be nice.
Amazingly good music!,"This is one of my all-time favorite albums, and I've listened to it over and over since I got it."
Cannot believe the fashion reviews,"The product is dark for a ""light"" based concealer, it goes on too thick and does not cover dark circles very well. Had to let it set and then repeat which by lunch time left a mess under my eyes.I will use my store brand stick which is goes on as ""light"", is smooth and covers in one application."
Ya'll want a single?,"Not really, no. It's a very good song and Twisted Transistor is great too. But again . . . this is a single. Single's kinda suck . . . honestly if you ""need"" this song, the entire CD itself is mere pennies more than this. Plus, this gets two of the songs that saw the most radio airtime, and misses sevearl other great songs on it. In my opinion, Coming Undone isn't the best song on the CD anyway. I do agree with many people that the direction koRn has been taking is sorta . . . disappointing, but that's for another discussion. I wouldn't get this. Just get the CD."
Slawter,"If you read the other two books of the Demonata, this one isn't good. You learn nothing, it's just a intermezzo i think. You are back whit Grubbs as your narrator, and if you couldn't adapt to Kernel, the one in the second book, this is a releafe! I allmost feared, i'ld have to cope whit another narrator, but i'm glad where back at Grubbs.The story is built up quite nice, but like the other two books, VERY slow. You have 150 pages about a film set, Grubbs' fears, etc. etc... But once the action starts, you can't stop reading. But you have to because the book ends when there was a lot of open space to kill some main caracters, which i want dead! Not to be cruel, but Mr. Shan has missed a lot of oppurtunities in this book."
Accurate Depiction of Teen Struggles,"This was a great depiction of what it is like to be a teen and dealing with the desires for romantic relationships. I thought the flow was great and accurately depicted typical scenarios. However, I would like to see more propaganda for teens to not only abstain from sex but from the heavy kissing and petting that only deepens the threat of temptation to have sex. It saddens me the examples set for young people that heavy kissing which almost always involves petting is just part of dating. Where is the message of saving every part of your body? Overall this was a great book to interest a young person. I am a parent of a pre-teen and she will be reading this book as part of educating her on the dangers of stepping out of God's Plan for her and her body. Thanks Josh for being so active in this way."
Don't Buy.,"I bought it, and it was decent but after a day the sub-woofer stopped working. I wasn't even near it when it blew out, all i did was turn it on and the sub-woofer was not playing anything."
Good Read,"A good read with useful tips on how to be not just presentable but charming.From face,hair,fashion to how you should present your best in gatherings, parties etc...would surely recommend this book to my friends!"
Noisy as all get out,"My wife bought this mobile for our newborn baby. Assembly was relatively easy and it looks nice but once we turned it on we were horrified! The rotating mechanism makes an awful grinding/clacking sound as it turns! I don't know if this is just a bad unit, or if this is a 'normal' sound but this clearly wont do. Back to the store with this puppy! Several other reviewers have mentioned similar problems so they've either got quality control issues at the factory or some peoples notions of 'soothing' are diametrically opposed to mine."
Fun movie,I'm not a batman fanatic but I got this video for my 4.5 year old son. He certainly enjoys it! Even my husband and I get a kick out the movie:) I would certainly recommend this product.
not for a 3-year old,"My daughter is 7 and can confidently manipulate fitting the small sprites in the different areas of the playset. However, I cannot see how a 3-year old would have the dexterity to accomplish this. Also,I think the small parts and sprites would still pose a choking hazard."
Much too flexible,"Quivers like a trampoline while climbing or descending. Very disturbing. As others have said, there are dangers and difficulties extending it when using it in ""Extension"" mode. Heavy. I would not have bought it had I used it first and can not recommend it. I wish I had got a simple extension instead. Does NOT convert to two scaffold bases, that is an outright lie."
Total rubbish,"This film really is rubbish, its dull, the acting is awful and the ""Suprise"" at the end isnt a suprise because u must be stupid if you dont see it coming.I agree with the person who said the 5* reviews sound dodgy, they defo had something to do with the movie."
"Great Series, Poor Product","The Sopranos series is one of my favorites. That being said, I would not advise anyone to buy this collection. There are so many discs that having even one of them not work makes it not worth it. Buyers would be better off getting each season individually as the chance of defective discs is less of a hassle since you don't have to send the enteire series back just for one or two defective discs. Personally, I could not play the dics on my playstation 2, which acts as my DVD player for my home theatre. The PS2 will play any other movies and HBO series just fine, but The Sopranos discs will only play reliably on my computer. I can usually get one or two episodes of each disc to work on my PS2, but then it becomes unable to read disc and I have to put them in my computer to finish watching them."
REALISTIC.....NO! ENTERTAINING......YES! 3 1/2 STARS!,"I know there are a lot of people who hate this film, but no matter how stupid it may be, it's a very entertaining movie. If you are a movie lover who wants everything to be completely believable and realistic then this is not the movie for you. If you are on the other hand the type of movie lover who likes an incredible and fun thrill ride then should make film will make your day.It's an action movie in every sense of the word with liable characters and many over the top and unrealistic moments. This is a popcorn munchin' thrill/laugh and even get a lump in your throat at the end kinda movie! Well worth watching silly or not!....it's just a movie...right? so take your brain out and enjoy this film for what it is."
Goosebumps = Good stuff,"I'm brand new to Broken Social Scene, and I credit iTunes for providing the samples that led to my decision to pick this up. For one, I'm a big fan of Metric, and when I heard ""Swimmers,"" I instantly recognized the lovely Emily Haines' vocals, and was already 3/4 sold. By the time I'd heard all the samples, I was ready to get the record. I found the compositions to strike the same vein as Radiohead (stop with your comments already); let's just say when I get goosebumps listening to music there's something more cerebral going on than just another Top 40 mega-production.Not sure why there are no samples here (yet?) iTunes has the samples, but buy the record elsewhere; the artists make more royalty and iTunes limits your sound quality to their compressed format (AAC), so if your a purist and want the best quality you can get, well, you get my point.Goosebumps..."
Put the correct subtitles back,"Until the issue witht the subtitles is corrected and labeled as such so I know what I'm ordering, I will be have to pass on ordering this excellent film."
Vater Vintage Bomber Beater,"Sounds very vintage. Replace my old Speed King beater with this one, and it definitely gets that older sound. The shaft is a little bit odd of a width, and I've found it sometimes doesn't fit into some pedals. But if it does, it works really well, and sounds awesome. Love the feel it adds."
can i give it zero stars?,"Amazon won't allow zero stars it turns out, but that is what this book deserves.When your midwife tells you to throw the book out, then you know it's a bad book. I won't even give it away. This and its companion of what to eat when expecting need to be gotten rid of. This book is a large volume of anxiety and unless you want to be freaked out during your pregnancy, avoid it like the plague. I have no idea how it gets re-published, why it is even in print to begin with. The woman is no authority but acts like she is some sort of expert with a preachy tone and inaccurate information.Please, do yourself and your loved ones, and your future baby a favor and read anything written by Dr. Sears. Even Jill Iovine's Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy is way better and entertaining too."
Made in France,"The newer ones aren't made in France. Even though these say they are, I would ask first. Some stores still have limited quantities of the old that are superior quality."
"Weird film, but the ride on the train was great","Jean Renoir made his version of Zola's novel. What is fun here is the fabulous sights we see while on the train thru France. Beatiful b&w; photography, mind you.Now, the story I didn't quite get it. I didn't get to care too much about the afflicted engineer; his psyche is really weird to me. Then there's his relationship with the unorthodox femme fatal, for whom I didn't care much either. So the study of characters isn't the best one I've seen in film history.In brief, boring but beautiful. There are better Renoir films to choose from."
DON'T BUY KODAK PRODUCTS,"I bought a Kodak Easyshare Z1275 about 3 years ago. Never dropped it or abused it in any manner. Was taking pictures and suddenly horizontal white, yellow, and blue stripes appeared on the LCD screen with a washed out image. Pictures were the same. Upon searching the internet I found that the cause was that the CCD in many manufacturers cameras built at that time were faulty and prone to failure. Other manufacturers were replacing the CCD's for no charge. When I called Kodak I was told that the camera was out of warranty and it would cost about $100 ($80 + shipping and handling + tax) or I could get a 15% discount on another Kodak camera if purchased over the internet from the Kodak website. Never again Kodak! They don't stand behind their defective merchandise."
Theocracy in the jungle,"While the writers are earnest and sincere, the evangelical overlay often gets in the way of a good adventure story. The fact that the somewhat hapless expedition didn't end in disaster is, in my mind, a shaky premise from which to deduce ""God's will."" Was impressed more by the compassion of those they happened to meet while off on their ""vision quest."""
Great deal on air pump,"After looking at this pump in stores I found it for less at Amazon. It works really well and is great if you need to air up your tire in an emergency. The light works great, too."
Motion light worked for a short time only - 1 month,"I ordered 3 of these units, 2 of which were installed. One was working great for about 3 weeks, and now it turns on sometimes, and not at other times. I can walk up to it in the middle of the night and wave my hand over the motion sensor and it will not turn the lights on. Then recently, on few occasions, it turns on, but one has to be a few feet away, even though it is set to high sensitivity. The other installed unit appears to have a broken sensitivity button. It is too sensitive and turns on repeatedly without noticeable motion changes. Cheap price, but not worth it if it does not work. Going to install the 3rd unit I purchased to replace one of the installed two units. Hope it works..."
Jump start,"Excellent jump starter. Packaging for it was poor. A heavy item like this should have had styrofoam around it to protect it. Box it was in was almost open when it arrived. The dc charger was broken because the item was not properly packaged. But the dc charger is practically useless anyway. The jumper itself is a good, sturdily built item."
Works for me.,"I was a bit concerned about purchasing this product considering the statements here. But, i ended up getting it anyway. What i did was to uninstall the 2 previous programs i had. NIS 2004 and NAV 2003 i believe. Then i used a registry cleanup program i was sent by the makers of my PC that was sent to me for an unrelated problem. After that i installed NIS 2005 without any problems at all. It has been running fine on my PC for about 2 months now."
WYSIWYG,"Great handbook. Some of the more commonly used sections have more details, some things less commonly referenced have little to no details. The negative reviewer obviously doesn't know what he's talking about. This book covers exactly what it's supposed to. I wouldn't want a person who doesn't even know the difference between NESC and NEC to do ANY kind of electrical work. The only thing to really note is that the book is seriously small. The pictures make it appear to be a full sized text book but it's really about half size. That's not a big deal but I just was a little surprised when I got it. Like the other review said though, this is not a substitute for the IEEE NESC book, but appears to provide a good overview of what are probably the more commonly referenced rules."
The Cook's Tour,"First we were all treated by Ms. baxter's grand tour of Hell. Now, she's been to Heaven, too!! My, my, my. And the pathetic thing is that people will actually believe this stuff and put out good money for it. Where's the next trip? Purgatory?"
awesome till it exploded,"Had it for about 6 months but when I was torqueing on my seat rails, the metal rod inside snapped sending my entire multitool allen keys all over the trail."
DISAPPOINTED!,"NOT ONLY DID THIS ITEM SHIP DAMAGED, NOW I HAVE TO PAY TO SEND IT BACK! DESCRIPTION SAYS THE LANGUAGE IS ENGLISH- THE CASE IS PRINTED IN KOREAN! MAY SOUND LIKE A GREAT DEAL, IT IS NOT. IT TOOK 4 WEEKS TO RECEIVE ITEM. NOW IT IS ON BACKORDER AND WOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT WAS IN STOCK AGAIN. I AM DEMANDING A REFUND!!!"
So-so,"Decently written and dealing with topics (adoption, abuse, etc.) of concern. But an obvious take-off of the Midnight Louie, Sneaky Pie, and Joe Gray feline sleuth mysteries. If you like this series, go on to the others - you may not be back."
You will never forget it....,"I have yet to find a movie that instilled as much fear in me as the orginal story of Michael Myers. This movie is not about the gore snf blood we so often see in movies these days, yet, it scares you to the core. Michael Myers is more than just a killer, he is a fear that stays inside you. Run all you want, he will walk and he will find you. You can't overcome his strength. This movie will make you look behind you to make sure nobody is following you, and trust me, you will not want to be in your home alone after watching this. This is a classic and will always be. By Far the best horror movie ever"
4 out of sixteen!,"I thought this album was going to be sweet because the two video's and the first two songs on the album. Thats it. Except for track 11 (YOUS A HO) the rest of the songs are really weak. I like about 3 of 4 songs on the album. The album is funny, dont get me wroung but you have to fast forward a lot."
Not 8 inches,"Just like other reviewer said, this is more like 9 inches, at the top it goes close to 10. I think it is neither the merchant nor Amazon's fault, the original sticker on the pan says 8in."
Not nearly as good as everyone said!!!!,I loved the description of this book- it sounded like something I would enjoy. I was wrong. I read the reviews and most were glowing...... but I was bored!!!! Didn't keep my attention! NOT worth the money at all
A beautiful book!,"I grabbed this book because about 5 years ago I was told about it, and it sounded amazing. As a cat lover, I love anything on cats (of course), and have a wide range of cat and kitten books. This is a different and unusual book. I am SO glad I got it. I am absolutely amazed with the photographs. I have to admit I haven't read it cover to cover yet, I'm still wrapped up in the pictures, but from what I have read, it's beautifully written. This is a musthave for catlovers. A wonderful, brilliant and splendid book!8/10"
Lame!,"I agree with the reviewer who said ""avoid at all costs"". Melanie Griffith's limited acting skills aside, the script is pathetic. This type of film about the 'hooker with the heart of gold' has already been done (and better) in ""Pretty Woman"". If the boys in the story had been a bit older, this might have worked as a teen-sex comedy (a la ""Risky Business""), but the result is just plain dumb! The scene in the classroom where Frank (the main kid)gives a sex education presentation using Griffith as a visual aid was downright offensive - did he think he'd get an 'A' on that? Frank is supposed to be the hero of the movie; do 'good' kids (how old is he, 11 or 12?) go propositioning strange women on the streets of Pittsburgh with money they've obtained through selling porn magazines? Meanwhile, the scenes of his best friend's father seeking out Griffith for a tryst were not funny at all and just added yet more sleaze to this already repugnant flick. To sum it up in one word: Pass!"
Cleans nicely,"This shampoo cleans nicely however it is very thin and I need to use a lot to get any sort of lather. Also it smells very strong of earth and herbs, and the scent stays with you."
don't waste the money,My daughter is 5 and she loves barbie and wanted these dolls She got the princess and prince and horse and carriage for Christmas The Princess left foot fell off Christmas Day and The Carriage would not stay connected to the horse When we went to change the dolls clothes the necklace broke It is now April and almost nothing is left that can be played with The prince did stay together but she doesn't like playing with it without the barbie There are plenty of other barbie that are much better
"Great watch, though it is now dead...","I have worn this watch nonstop for the last 3 years and it has had a hard life on my wrist! It is scratched and battered, but it keeps going and water has still not gotten into it like other watches I have worn. This is a great thing since I am a fishing guide and need a watch that can keep up with me. Unfortunately, the battery is now dead and I haven't gotten around to getting it changed out, but believe me, I will! Also, be sure to set the watch to your time zone and latitude/longitude in order for the fishing function to be more accurate."
practicle casting,is mostly clear and to the point.illustrations are good.examples are a little lacking.navigation through the book is easy.its hard cover is an advantage in studios.
Great Cookie Sheets,"I bought these as a replacement for a set , from another brand , that were awful , they did all the bad things that a prior reviewer spoke of buckling etc.Prior to this , I had owned a professional collectors version of this set . After 5 years of heavy use and some abuse , it was time to replace them . I couldn't find the same set, they don't make them any more . I went with the lesser brand and was very disappointed.This set works great , I made a batch of cookies tonight , they cooked evenly , the sheet was stable and clean up was a snap. My only bug-a-boo with this set is is has Calphalon in big raised letters on the cooking side of the sheet , right smack in the middle ... I don't like the thought of one of my cookies being labeled lol so I used one of my silicone baking mats on top of it."
Not the Best of 'em-but need to read,"The stories of Harry Potter are definitely some of the most original and creative stories I've read. This first novel introduces the ideas and characters very well yet once you've read the other books of the series, you will see how this is certainly not the best. When I finished this book (as well as the second one-The Chamber of Secrets) I thought that it was a very well writen children's story. It's almost like a fairy tale. It's not until later that it changes a bit to show that there actually are some serious issues in this fantasy world. I would definitely recomend this book but just know that if you aren't that impressed with it (or the next one), keep going. It gets better than this."
Cracked Case,"The movie is great, but it was said to be in great condition. The dvd has some slight scratches and even pauses for a few seconds in 2 places and the case was completely cracked up. No inserts were with it, which is no big deal. I order from Amazon all of the time and this is the first time I was disappointed."
Heart stopping and intense,"""o"" was an exceptional movie. I have never been much for drama but I descided to see it anyway. Josh hartnett's ( Black hawk down, 40 days and 40 nights) performance was breakthough. It really showed how talented he is. Mekhi Phifer (Honey, 8 mile) and Julia Stiles { Save the last dance, 10 things I hate about you) shared alot of depth and chemistry in this film. Tim Nelson did a great job foccusing on Josh Hartnett and Mekhi Phifer's strange relationship together. This move was very intense and full of twists and turns. The cast was nearly perfect. I beleive every actor play there part exactly as was scripted plus added edgy touches and breakthrough perfomances. If you are easily frusterated with drama movies I do not reccomend this movie. But if you enjoy intensity and drama this move is a definate for you."
Disappointing,"I purchased this product on the strength of the other review and because I was looking for a cheap camera that would take decent photos. Unfortunately, my 15 dollar drug store digital takes better photos than this little guy. I read all the directions and checked to make sure I wasn't making mistakes, but in the end, I had to admit I had purchased in haste. The camera has no low light capabilities (all photos taken in house were dark), pictures taken outside had sun glare, and the digital zoom is not really helpful for close ups. It's really a camera for those who don't really care about the quality of their pictures."
They sell returned goods,I was very disappointed with this item. This is clearly a returned item and packed with a broken box. This is a prestige item and is a gift. I paid full price but got a used item. Go buy direct from Waterford you pay full price and get brand new stuff.Too late to return as this is a Christmas present for my wife. I have to tell my wife I got it from Amazon.com. Shame on you Amazon!
Very nice..,"This is a nice little monograph....The photographs are quite good, and the text is clear. She has a few very useful algorithms. Fairly expensive for just thyroid cytopath book (for ~$150 you can get a good general cytopath text like Atkinson or Renshaw), but the quality is good."
Don't think it's Japanese,"I bought this video because as a Japanese, I want to know something about Karate in my workout. But this video was total disappointment to me. The studio is decorated in some misterious oriental taste unnecessarily, but don't think it's Japanese style! The moves are too quick to follow and not like Karate I know of."
False Advertising,The image depicted in the ad is for a wood grained back board but in the Title/Descriptor the vendor states 90114 White Thermometer.The image falsley suggests that the item for sale is a wood grained item when in fact it is a much less attractive white plastic item.Let the Buyer Beware!!!
very confusing to program,"received quickly, but way to complicated to program and the price that it is, its not worth the headache at all"
Gets better the more you listen,"I've had this CD for a few years, but I never quite understood their sound until I had the pleasure of seeing them in concert in Galway, Ireland while I was there for several months. Since then I've had a renewed interest in this CD and their music and general, and here is why. These talented musicians have such a strong understanding of the music, and their arrangements of the tunes are unbelievable. Low whistles aren't exactly common-place as the lead instruments in Irish music, but Lunasa proves that they can be. The way they take traditional tunes and layer the various parts turns the music into a true work of art. The more I listen to Irish music and develop my own abilities as an Irish flutist, the more I understand how amazing Lunasa's approach to music really is. Buy this CD and really pay attention to every detail. You will be amazed."
Yeah...not so much,"While I feel that Fergie has some real vocal talent, I'm not digging this album. I bought it hoping for an up-beat, workout type album, but I was sadly disappointed. I like the reggae-type beat of Mary Jane Shoes,the fun beat of Fergalicious, and the realness of Losing My Ground and Finally. In the end, though, I can't help but shake the idea Fergie thinks she's a little hotter than she really is."
Mike McGonigal sucks,"The ""two Sausages kissing remark is inane"", Mike. Grow out of your 20-year-old, hipper-then-thou smarminess and try to play an instrument for a decade or two then try and get a record produced and distributed for a fan base that does not seek to rule the world with banal quips and Saturday night pedantry.The album is not great. 70s prog rock is musician-music. White Stripes suck. Go back to the tavern for another thought-provoking session of Guiness, mate, and leave the music reviews to people a little less insipid."
big disappoinment,"This book was recommended to me by a longtime Dick Francis fan. I, too, am a Dick Francis fan but this book is a huge dasappointment. It's been several years since I've read Francis but this isn't the writing style I remember. Sentences ramble on; I found myself rereading sentences hoping they would make more sense the second time around. One reviewer wondered if this was ghost written. The same thought crossed my mind. If you really enjoy Dick Fracis as I do, don't read this book. Remember him at his finest."
Poor Design...,"This lock is of such a poor design that it should be removed from the market. The premise of the design is good, but it does not take into account today's larger/longer lugnuts or recessed wheel openings. I regret purchasing this product, no wonder the price was so cheap. I ended up buying a set of locking lugnuts, I suggest you do the same."
Great Scope,Not Much to say other then it fit my 10/22 perfectly and was dead on accurate out of the box .very happy.
the first one's better,"October Faction aren't for everyone, that's for sure. This cd isn't all that great(mojo magazine in an article about SST compared its interest to watching grass grow). The first October Faction record, recorded live opening for Black Flag I believe, is actually pretty good though. I'd suggest getting that cd and then if you really like it, then think about getting this one."
sappy and tedious,"This movie is a dog. I found the flashback fantasies annoying, sappy, and boring all at the same time. The ""love your father"" moral is laudable, but the execution is painful at best. Don't even rent this one."
Great Follow-Up,"Ride the Lightning is Metallica second strongest album. This album has some of Metallica's best songs. This is the album for new Metallica fans. My personal recommendations include, ""Ride The Lightning"", ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", ""Fade to Black', and ""Escape"". A must have for Metallica fans."
the greatest rock and roll band around!!!,"This has to be the most talented band of our time. ""Urban Hymms"" is a great listen from beginning to end. If you like this one, there are two other cd's you must have... ""A Northern Soul"" and ""A Storm In Heaven"" also by The Verve. Their music will make you forget about shallow bands like Backstreet Boys, N-Sync, Barenaked Ladies, and so on.... Come On America!!!"
"AKA ""Enemy From Space""","Well I remember the afternoon I sat as a ten year old, glued to the TV, mesmerized by fear, as this creepy story unfolded!! I can only add my two cents' worth to the above excellent reviews of this 1957 (and wasn't THAT a great year for SF movies?) gem: (1) The score by James ""The Devil Rides Out"" Bernard. I think a CD is available of some of his film music, including ""Q2""....Wonder if ol' Bernard Hermann saw this movie before he scored ""sycho""? (2) The ""...H U M A N P U L P !!"" scene towards the end in the control room. O that the modern movies left more to the imagination!!"
fast paced military/court room drama,The main character in this novel is an honorable military officer who chooses to take the right action morally and legally while putting his own career in peril. The book is fast paced with the chapters broken down into hours and days as the action builds up to the final climax in what seems like real time.
Thrilling!!!,I got this book from my world history teacher for extra credit and when I got started to read I couldn't stop reading it! I would spend 5 or more hours straight reading this book. I would recommend to everyone if they asked me about! I loved it!!!
Saxon Goes To America,"Destiny was the very first Saxon album I purchased. And as such I have to admit to having a slight bias towards this album.The second song "" Where The Lightning Strikes "" was and still is one of my all time favorite songs. I love the guitar riffs and 80's style chorus.Of course when you start comparing this album with earlier and later material, is simply falls flat on its face like a mouse that decided that the cheese on the trap looked rather tasty.There are a few other tracks that stand out but as a whole this album is one to miss. Start your Saxon adventure with Denim and Leather or a couple of the newest releases as Saxon have blasted back into life recently."
Not in my interest,"Well not bashing the book or anything, but this book just totally bored me in every way. I couldn't even finish it, I read the first 170 pages and just had to stop! I couldn't read anymore. To me this book seems like it would be more in the interest of an older reader, not as much as a younger reader."
Great speaker for little cash,I got these for my plow truck.. i listen to mostly rock and i was really impressed with them. There not stompers but for 25 bucks shipped for two pairs you can not beat these!! the highs sound great and the lows are pretty good as well.. since my speakers are in my doors im not expecting much for bass responce... good buy!! came fast too!!!
Two Eagles in the Sun,"Campbell does a great job offering concise information about Mexican Culture as it is related to the USA and Latin America. He offers insight for the Borderlands and the interior. This book is like the ""Cliffs Notes"" of Mexico. For a fast and easy-to-read book filled with information about issues such as: Battles, Holidays, Economy, History of the Country, Impact of NAFTA, Attitudes of Mexican People, etc.This is a great reference tool that you will want on your bookshelf for a long time. It offers the nuts and bolts of the issues and you do not have to read all night to find the scoop on the situation. For further reading, the appendix and bibliography is great."
Retarded,"Don't be fooled by the look of this product. It's a piece of crap.1. There's only one button play/pause. 2. There's only one damn button. 3. No volume, track navigation, and you have to wear it around your neck all the time because the lousy headphones are integrated with the strap. I found it for $50 @ Target and already returned it!"
Returned twice--both defective in alignment,"I'm sure these binoculars are good in many ways, especially for the price, but mine were defective immediately out of the box--twice. I purchased a pair and found myself unable to correctly focus the image (yes, I followed all the directions). My image was doubled, and I looked up alignment problems and tested it by focusing on a horizontal wire and then slowly separating the lenses; the line was disconnected, indicating that the binoculars were not aligned. This is not something one can fix, and Bushnell's warranty requires paying shipping. I returned them to Amazon for a replacement, and found the replacement had the same issue, albeit not to as great of an extreme. Nonetheless 2 minutes of looking out of these would give anyone a headache."
Pretty cool chair,"I purchased this stool to go with a craft/drafting table that I had purchased for my craft room. My other chair wasn't high enough and I needed something adjustable and quality because I spend a lot of time there. I was impressed at how solid the parts were when I was unpacking. Each part is well built and well made. Even the plastic bottom that the casters go in is a heavy duty plastic. I was able to put it together in about 15 minutes which is amazing for me because I always struggle with assembling items. Just be careful when you purchase and make sure you are buying the right height. Unfortunately, it is just a little higher than I wanted."
Not at all wat expected,This cd is a dissapointment. I heard the group r spliting up and this is not a good way to finsih it. It shows that Tim Armstrong really is a sell-out. He's probably gunna go big w/ transplants since their songs he put time and heart into while this album is so non hard tempo its like rock. The cd had 1 good song its no fall back down. just download the song indestructible off the web and u've got the whole cd 1 good song. Rancid 2000 was awsome hard fast punk like it should be. I had high hopes for Indestructible the only thing indestructible is Tim's ego. unless he can prove me wrong wit ha new kick as Rancid cd in the next few years. All their other cds were good tho they life wont wait cd was the crappiest other than this. The self titled song life wont wait is awsome cept they ruiend it with that stupid reggae guy in it stupid and bad choice.
not actual 8 gauge wire,"Either I got a bad kit or the gauge was sized by the wire and insulation together because all my other 8 gauge cable I had was much bigger. The RCA cables are fine, the signal wire was very small gauge, didnt end up using the speaker wires. The connectors or terminals were junk as well. Got what I paid for this time."
A book with no content,"Someone wrote a book on how to make ""friends"" and glorified himself the whole way through it, and even better I'm guessing he had his ""friends"" write reviews on how helpful it was. Impressive. I actually saw Mr. Ferrazzi speak out here on the east coast, and for an hour and a half he spoke about how to build relationships while speaking of every CEO/CMO/COO he's ever met, the book is much the same. He should of just made a list of names...Larry,Bob,Joseph,Bill,Christian,Henry,Donald, etc... I'm glad I kept my receipt."
Ack!,"For an AP world high school class textbook, the chapters are supersaturated with information, with no distinction as to what is important and what isn't thus when outlining chapters one is forced to have outlines almost as long as the chapter since there is no distinction of importance in the information. Each chapter is very long and there is continual jumping from time and culture. In addition, much of the writing is stretched out when it shouldn't be. It is not concise or pithy but pretentiously blown out. In short, it is boring, unclear, nonlinear, disorganized, too long. Get anything else but this."
Ok for the price!!,I have a Sony Ericsson T-610 and i had some difficulty pairing Anycom HS-777 with it. Initially i was not able to to recieve incoming calls thru it. Then i figured that i had to hold the button a little longer (the manual did not say this). Also the thing that loops around your ear is too big and gets very uncomfortable. I would suggest buy it only if your use is minimal.. you cannot wear it all the time.
Wiggles Fan,"My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES the Wiggles. I have had to add more and more Wiggles DVD's to our collection to keep ME from getting bored with the same old one over and over (and over and over!). Both of these are fun to watch and feature some of our favorite songs (no ""Little Wiggles"" or animated Wiggles which we don't really care for as much). My husband and I are pretty big Wiggles fans too so we don't mind watching the DVD's along with our son - plus it can be good aerobic exercise too! :-)"
larger size... please!,"would like to see a larger version for the ""big head"" people in the world. Mine barely fit and I rarely use them."
bought in store,bought this watch at waalmart for 89$ and saw it here for half the price. I am telling anyone this is one fo the best watches i have had in a long time. I have a rolex and invicta and also movado but love th elook and also the feel of this one especially for all my sport needs.
"They ""forget"" to mention something","Without a cablecard from your cable TV provider, this box cannot get digital channels. This makes it a hunk of scrap without the additional hassle of dealing with Comcast et al. (Ugh.)"
What Do You Mean No Spoken Words?,"Quest for FireI told my teenage Grand-Daughter this movie had no words and you should have seen the look I got. Reluctantly she started watching with me and then she wanted to buy her own copy. This is a genius film that you will never forget and want to watch again and again over the years as I have. It contains all the emotions you want from a film and if you enjoy books like Jean Auel writes, you're going to place the Disc with those books. We think of the ""Cavemen"" that lived on this earth so long before us as being the same. With critical research that's been done it shows us what really was. All kinds of people with different looks, languages, foods and skills. They learned from each other, either by choice or not. This is a must see."
So Awesome and Funny,"This dvd box set is one of the best purchases I've ever made, I just love it.Incredibly cool funny funny funny."
Dummies pick something else in this case,"Got some ""dummies"", but this is not the best one. The contents of the supplied CD-ROM is hardly useful for beginners. Project 2003 Step by Step is imo a better book with good digital samples and a digital version of the book on the CD-ROM."
Very Uncomfortable & Awkard,"I expected more from an Altec Lansing product. I was very disappointed that they were so awkward and uncomfortable on my head. As the other reviews have said, the sound quality is poor and they pop off my head if I try to wear them at the gym. Basically, I tried wearing them for 2 days but ended up returning them (paying for shipping of course) and buying a better made product for the same price."
"Interesting, but not great","The plot-line of this novel is interesting. Unfortunately, the writing style leaves something to be desired. With no character development to speak of, the reader starts to care more about the museam the story takes place in--desiring more descriptions of it--and not the characters themselves.As for the ""big secret"" of Mbwen, I personally had it figured out within the first couple of pages.On the whole, the book is worth reading once, but not more than that."
Excellent Product,"Excellent for my small-breed dog. Your dog may prefer specific flavors so try them all as they come in two chews to a pack, small size treat for small size ball/holder. My pup likes the chicken it came with, but does not care for the liver; I put a different flavor on each side. My dog loves to lick and chew this and it seems to not be affected. I think this is my dogs favorite chew toy and I highly recommend your dog try one of these. The chews seem to last a long time and not break apart, so far. I recommend all chewing devices be supervised during use."
New favorite album,"With MP3 players, it is very rare these days for me to listen to an entire album start to finish (I usually jump around so much). Colbie Caillat's new album, Coco, however has been in my car's CD player non-stop since I got it a few weeks back. My favorite track is ""Magic"" and I listen to it by far the most. ""Bubbly"" and ""Capri"" are also close seconds. Honestly though, all the tracks are great, and there isn't a single one I skip over - as so often happens with most CDs.I would also recommend buying / downloading her other titles that are available but do not appear on this album ""Mistletoe,"" ""Dreams Collide,"" ""Older"" and ""Circles.""The only possible negative I would give to this album is the background vocalist. He does not have a very good voice, and when his track is turned up too loud, he can really detract from Colbie's voice. She is best at her purest (ie - no background vocals) - like in Capri."
"It works but, you have to know what you're doing","I must say... i havent completly read it. But anyway, the book is ok, the author talks not only about the subject but also give advices about working as a game programmer and in the end suggests a lot of books to continue learning.The reason of the title of this review is because you have to actually have a solid base of c++ wich means that you must have the ability to read and understand code on your own even when the author explains it well because some examples can be a bit confusing if you don't."
An interesting if not scholarly account of a troubled town.,"Strife in the Sanctuary is an interesting read, but doesn't fully explain what it sets out to explore: Why would a small religious community expel some of its members for getting too religious? This fascinating question is raised, but the author does not employ journalistic or scholarly methods or reasoning to find answers and relies a bit too much on gossip and his own opinions and beliefs to make his point. I enjoyed the book, I just wish the research was more thorough."
I've never read worse writing...,"The Edge was the first book of Ms Coulters I've ever read and it will be the last. I had to finish by reading parts out loud to my boyfriend...we howled! They use a machete to cut a passage through the rain forest...and then they ""minimize"" the trail?How can she be a bestseller?"
dimensions are perfect,size is perfect for my new bed. slides well and for the past 1 month it as been holding up well. as others have stated the plastic is not that sturdy and i am uncertain if it will last.
Inane and annoying,"When traveling, I always try to take location appropriate literature along. This seemed to be a particularly good choice for a visit to Venice. Long after returning from the vacation, I'm still trying to force myself to finish this book. It is self-indulgent and inane. If the use of the phrase ""don't be rough,"" (I could never figure out what was rough) over and over and over again is not enough to encourage throwing the book in the fire, then abundant use of ""I love you, whatever that means,"" should do it. I usually like Hemingway, this book is awful."
Funny and Charming,"Reading this book is a bit like a history lesson. Set in San Francisco in the late-1970s, this book was remarkable for presenting homosexuality as part of mainstream popular culture. In 2011 this is hardly shocking, but thirty-five years ago it was. This is important to recognize before going into the book.With the stage set, I felt like this book read like a sitcom. The characters engage in crazy antics. They get involved in humorous love triangles. The series began in the newspaper, and I can see how that shapes the book. The book is comprised of short chapters and small vignettes. It is humorous and easy reading, a bit of mind candy.By the end I was left with some unanswered questions. What was the issue with the landlady? As this is the first book in a series, I'm going to assume that Maupin is setting up for the next book. I'll be reading it to find out."
Poor Mexico!,I can't believe so- called geographers really place Mexico outside the Northern Hemisphere! Where did they go to school? This should be called Substandard Deviants! It really needs to be corrected or taken off the market. I want my money back!
A nice little Edwardian mystery!,"This book is set in the south coast of England during the Regency period (specifically 1908 for this one). Cecily finds her beloved Pennyfoot Hotel in the middle of another murder when one of her guests is found hanging from the Maypole. She of course can't resist trying to find out who the killer is since she doesn't have much faith in the police getting anywhere, so she starts asking questions. These books are nice little cozies, but the mystery in this one is pretty simple to figure out. I enjoy Cecily and her friends and staff though, so I will read more in the series."
misleading book,"Very misleading package. There's a brief Graham Greene story, plus a miscellany of unorganized, sometimes fragmentary, and rarely interesting ephemera from writers you've never heard of. It's almost surely not what you're thinking it is. I'd pass."
Okay for a cheap bike,"I got this bike to see if I could get back in to the good old sport of mountain biking. This bike was a good encouragement...but I had a few problems with it even after getting it tuned twice.1) The brakes were never tight enough.2) The chains were slipping off and hitting the wheels.3) The wheels were out of line.But all in all, for the price...I can't really complain...but I'll probably get a new bike as soon as this one falls apart even more."
Sofie Metropolis,I read about 20 pages and then tossed this book. Very contrived series of one liners. Would not buy any other books by Carrington.
Ron White behavioral problems,I am a FORMER fan. This DVD was NOT entertaining -- just plain filthy.I haven't even opened it -- I saw part of it on Comedy Central and was totally disappointed.
boring album with few good tracks,"This album I can say is probably the worst album Marillion has to offer. Boring songs like Interior Lulu, Home, and several others lacks the energy of other marillion songs. Some songs are empty feeling messes, While other songs like Built In Bastard Radar, When I Leave You, Tumble Down THe Years bring light to this album, the rest is pretty lifeless. The only people I can recommend this album to, are the true fans of the band. The rest stay away."
good kid's video,"This video is excellent for children to begin learning about physics. I'm twenty eight, and I overlooked the description and bought this not realizing it was a child's dvd. That was okay with me because my physics knowledge is pretty much at a kindergarten level, and this was a easy place to start my learning. Pretty embarrassing,though! Also, the dvd doesn't play all through, you can watch each law of physics section separately, so if your kid has a 3 second attention span, that's okay because each section is quite short."
Ahh.....I love this one.,"The Renaissance is such an awesome album! I love Lonesome Town, Party, The Opposite, and Yuri Wakes up Screaming. I really recommend this album to anyone who is a MXPX fan. It rox!"
Pretty Good,"This book concerns itself with the USRA-designed steam locomotives built in 1918-1920 (though not with the copies of those designs built from 1920 onwards). There is a brief introduction explaining why the USRA was necessary as well. The author devotes a chapter to each wheel arrangement, setting forth the existing designs that might have served as precedents and adding without elaboration the railroads' comments on the engines' performance.The style is rather dry and academic but at the same time there is more material on this subject here than in any other single book. Apparently accurate data is hard to come by, but it would have been nice to see production broken out by builder and type as well as allocation. The absence of this data is the book's most serious fault.The book includes a large number of interesting photographs. All in all, not perfect but a worthwhile purchase for anyone interested in this era."
Garbage,"For people who like TV series with lots of violence, sex, corruption and excessive use of bad language, the Sopranos DVD's are tops.My purchase, after viewing only 2 discs has gone where it belongs....... the garbage bin."
Amazing show,"After LOST this is the next best series. Love it! Too sad it's ending this year, but all the seasons are worth watching and rewatching."
Great product - but its HUGE,"I was very impressed by this unitThe XM stations come in very clearly and the controls, for the most part, are pretty easy to useThe LCD is also pretty nice and clear ----- and most importantly, its real easy to hook it up into any sound source, through the headphone jackHowever, this thing is HUGE --- do not buy this with the intent of exercising or jogging with it --- you're better off with an iPod Shuffle for those purposesand of course, the price is up there ---- I'm tempted to wait for the next version, that's hopefully, smaller ----- however, it is a pretty good unit, so if you need an XM unit right now, and portability is a factor, then look no further"
Colorful book in pictures but just ok in instruction,The book is full of pictures and neat diagrams. But when it comes to explaining things in actual words this is where I have a problem. I am a 6th grader with good reading skills. Sometimes things are not explained to my satisfaction. A little jumpy is the word I would use to say why I give 3 stars. But for pictures this book is awesome.
Are you kidding me?!,"OK, so the author quotes Bible verses. Big deal! This book is just a way to justify sex outside of marriage. God speaks in many verses of the Bible how sexual immorality is not for anyone outside the bonds of marriage. Yes, I've read it, and I do not recommend it! You are on dangerous ground if you think this book says it better than God's own word, the Bible."
"Well-written, but basic, and includes many errors.","The ARP mistakes are the obvious problem. But there are quite a few other technical mistakes also. I questioned the likelihood of a network having 10,000 broadcasts per second. If each frame was 128 bytes, this would be more than 10 Mbps Ethernet. Also, IGMP stuff is bogus. And all mentions of calculating bandwidth usage are strange because they say things like 7 Mbytes instead of 7Mbytes/sec."
Abandon all Hope ye who Enter Here,"In all my life, I have only ever been unable to finish two books. Atonement is the second. After having such high hopes from other reviewers and friends, I made it halfway into this book - reaching, at last, the crime - before having to toss the book aside. It is cliche, none of the characters are remotely likable, or even bearable, and the writing is over-detailed to the point that it makes a reader struggle to remember what is actually happening in the story. It is with great regret that I am forced to add another book to my ""Unbearable"" list, and hope that no more innocents are trapped into reading Atonement."
Boring,"I cant believe so many people liked this movie. I rented it on DVD after I saw Napoleon Dynamite (sweeeet) and I thought it was horribly boring. The story itself was interesting and the characters were fantastic. That's the only good comment I can make. Yes, I laughed a few times. But mostly, I wanted to cry because the movie was so darned depressing. Maybe if you are someone who is looking for the meaning of life, this is a good movie. Mostly, I want to laugh and enjoy the movie."
Modern Day 2012 Garbage Re-Make,"Definitely made for today's generation. Different sountrack from the original, Ren's Mom is gone, Ren's from some other city (not Chicago), his friend Willard is very hard to understand. Dennis Quaid as Ariel's father seemed stiff in this, it just wasn't moving fluidly along. Ariel's boyfriend looked about 30 yrs. old. When playing ""chicken"" they used a school bus? LOL. Beaumont is now Bomont?Rap garbage music infiltrated this movie, not the place for it, along with line dancing to rap music? Odd. Some movies just should be left alone as originals. Where'd most of the original music go? They replaced it, ugh! Go with the 1984 version. The soundtrack rocked and so did the acting, dancing and the movie! I'm sure those that are 30 yrs. and younger will like this movie. I'm early 40's and have better taste than this. I thought I'd give it a shot. Hey they remade True Grit and it wasn't a flop so I've heard. Footloose- It's ok to pass a couple of hours, but not a keeper."
Amateurish,"I was really looking forward to getting this series of books based on reviews I have read here. I finally got a couple of the books and have been very disappointed. The plot is simple, the characters are either vapid or just a name, and the reading level is about 3rd grade. If you want a quick read with not much thought - despite people's claims of how well ""researched"" these books are - then these are the books for you. If you want a truly well-researched story with strong characters and a plot driven book then go back to Dan Brown."
Not worth all the hype - not at all,"I think this book, despite a few amazingly beautiful sentences and commentaries on humanity, is a self-indulgent piece of crap. I FORCED myself to finish it because of all the hype, because so many people spoke well of it. That was no easy task, nor did I ever feel that the effort paid off. Boring, solopsistic, (and once again) SELF INDULGENT. Yuck."
H. G. WELLS' TEH WAR OF THE WORLDS REVIEW,I liked this movie. The action bits were exciting. And Anthony Piana. Anthony Piana. Shirtless for half the movie. I could see more movies with eyecandy like him. Is there a fanclub where I can get pictures of him?
For ages 9months and under !,"The graphics are cool, not great, the game is not as realistic as older versions, the player moves slower than the normal pace one would expect from a tekken game. I would not reccomend the purchase of this game."
A total disgrace to literary theory and criticism,This book is an extremely superficial review of Barthes' theories. The illustrations are disgusting and totally not appropriate for this book. Roland Barthes was one of the greatest mid-20th century critics and philosophers and this is not the type of book he deserves. Whoever is interested in Roland Barthes is definitely not looking for this type of book. It is a total disgrace to his books and his persona.
Good quality,"For the price this monitor does wonders. I can hear my baby in the other room, with minor feedback on the monitor. I am happy with my purchase and would recomend it to others"
Starts nice but...,"Starts nice but... at the end it slows down, no good real practical info, lots of histories."
A Gentle Tale For Children,"In a era where our children are often bombarded with violence and scary stories at a very young age, The Chicken Without A Coop offers a gentle yet adventurous tale for kids 4 to 8 years of age. Columbus the cat helps his new friend, Henritta Hen, find a cozy home. A chicken using a cat-door? Humorous and touching...I recommend it!"
Needs to be more clear on what is reiki and what is not,"Diane does both a great service and disservice all at once with this book. One the plus side, she brings reiki out in the open so it is accessible to all. My problem with the book, is that she presents alot of material that is not reiki and is not always clear on what is and what is not reiki. Her Chi Kung exercises, are not reiki. Chi Kung is a seperate discipline that needs to be taught by a trained instructor, and can be potentially harmful without a competant instructor. Her history of reiki with a lineage back to christ, while amusing, is historical fiction and should be labelled as such or a the bare minimum labelled as her opinion only. There is also a decided Wiccan feel to the book, and while wicca is a wonderful time honored tradition, it is also not reiki. Her feminist writing style was amusing, and i actually enjoyed that."
Could have been a New Yorker article . . .,"had brevity been his strength. Except the New Yorker editors might have required a little more of Mr. Goldberg than his editors here required. Tempest in a teapot. ""How to turn an anecdote from your life into a cash stream"" should be the subtitle."
Breathtaking,"This book is as good as the first two. The characters continue to develop, the war continues, everyone is in peril...By now I have an emotional stake in the characters and, as with the previous ones, I was turning the pages as fast as I could to learn the outcome of each new situation. The plot twists had me holding my breath, and I nearly cried in several places.As with book two, the book ends in a maddeningly frustrating cliff hanger, and book four isn't due out until the fall. ARRGG!!!!This series is truly epic, and it's extremely well written. I can't stand it that the next book isn't out yet."
They work,"These mics work just fine in quiet places. I wanted these for my husband and I to communicate when we're riding our ATV's. Unfortunately the ATV's were too loud, and the mics wanted to stay on constantly. But the point is they work. I would recommend them."
"Good, fun read","i read this book many years ago, and forgot all about it. Them when I remembered something, I could not rememer who wrote it or the title. Glad I did, it was a fun, easy read. You can read above what the story is about. I would LOVE to see the same thing, but going from 2002 back to 1972. Would be cool"
